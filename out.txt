When
a
man
knocks
at
Uncle
Sam's
gate
craving
admission
to
his
house
we
ask
him
how
much
money
he
brings
lest
he
become
a
hindrance
instead
of
a
help
If
now
we
were
to
ask
what
he
brings
not
only
in
his
pocket
but
in
his
mind
and
in
his
heart
this
stranger
what
ideals
he
owns
what
company
he
kept
in
the
country
he
left
that
shaped
his
hopes
and
ambitions,--might
it
not
if
the
answer
were
right
be
a
help
to
a
better
mutual
understanding
between
host
and
guest
For
the
_Mayflower
did
not
hold
all
who
in
this
world
have
battled
for
freedom
of
home
of
hope
and
of
conscience
The
struggle
is
bigger
than
that
Every
land
has
its
George
Washington
its
Kosciusko
its
William
Tell
its
Garibaldi
its
Kossuth
if
there
is
but
one
that
has
a
Joan
d'Arc
What
we
want
to
know
of
the
man
is
were
its
heroes
his
This
book
is
an
attempt
to
ask
and
to
answer
that
question
for
my
own
people
in
a
very
small
and
simple
way
it
is
true
but
perhaps
abler
pens
with
more
leisure
than
mine
may
follow
the
trail
it
has
blazed
I
should
like
to
see
some
Swede
write
of
the
heroes
of
his
noble
chivalrous
people
whom
lack
of
space
has
made
me
slight
here
though
I
count
them
with
my
own
I
should
like
to
hear
the
epic
of
United
Italy
of
proud
and
freedom-loving
Hungary
the
swan-song
of
unhappy
Poland
chanted
to
young
America
again
and
again
to
help
us
all
understand
that
we
are
kin
in
the
things
that
really
count
and
help
us
pull
together
as
we
must
if
we
are
to
make
the
most
of
our
common
country
These
were
my--our--heroes
then
Every
lad
of
Northern
blood
whose
heart
is
in
the
right
place
loves
them
And
he
need
make
no
excuses
for
any
of
them
Nor
has
he
need
of
bartering
them
for
the
great
of
his
new
home
they
go
very
well
together
It
is
partly
for
his
sake
I
have
set
their
stories
down
here
All
too
quickly
he
lets
go
his
grip
on
them
on
the
new
shore
Let
him
keep
them
and
cherish
them
with
the
memories
of
the
motherland
The
immigrant
America
wants
and
needs
is
he
who
brings
the
best
of
the
old
home
to
the
new
not
he
who
threw
it
overboard
on
the
voyage
In
the
great
melting-pot
it
will
tell
its
story
for
the
good
of
us
all
To
those
who
wonder
that
I
have
left
the
Saga
era
of
the
North
untouched
I
would
say
that
I
have
preferred
to
deal
here
only
with
downright
historic
figures
For
valuable
aid
rendered
in
insuring
accuracy
I

A
KNIGHT
ERRANT
OF
THE
SEA
The
Eighteenth
Century
broke
upon
a
noisy
family
quarrel
in
the
north
of
Europe
Charles
the
Twelfth
of
Sweden
the
royal
hotspur
of
all
history
and
Frederik
of
Denmark
had
fallen
out
Like
their
people
they
were
first
cousins
and
therefore
all
the
more
bent
on
settling
the
old
question
which
was
the
better
man
After
the
fashion
of
the
lion
and
the
unicorn
they
fought
"all
about
the
town,
and
indeed
about
every
town
that
came
in
their
way
now
this
and
now
that
side
having
the
best
of
it
On
the
sea
which
was
the
more
important
because
neither
Swedes
nor
Danes
could
reach
their
fighting
ground
or
keep
up
their
armaments
without
command
of
the
waterways
the
victory
rested
finally
with
the
Danes
And
this
was
due
almost
wholly
to
one
extraordinary
figure
the
like
of
which
is
scarce
to
be
found
in
the
annals
of
warfare
Peder
Tordenskjold
Rising
in
ten
brief
years
from
the
humblest
place
before
the
mast
a
half-grown
lad
to
the
rank
of
admiral
ennobled
by
his
King
and
the
idol
of
two
nations
only
to
be
assassinated
on
the
"field
of
honor
at
thirty
he
seems
the
very
incarnation
of
the
stormy
times
of
the
Eleven
Years
War
with
which
his
sun
rose
and
set
for
the
year
in
which
peace
was
made
also
saw
his
death
Peder
Jansen
Wessel
was
born
on
October
28
1690
in
the
city
of
Trondhjem
Norway
which
country
in
those
days
was
united
with
Denmark
under
one
king
His
father
was
an
alderman
with
eighteen
children
Peder
was
the
tenth
of
twelve
wild
boys
It
is
related
that
the
father
in
sheer
desperation
once
let
make
for
him
a
pair
of
leathern
breeches
which
he
would
not
be
able
to
tear
But
the
lad
not
to
be
beaten
so
easily
sat
on
a
grind-stone
and
had
one
of
his
school-fellows
turn
it
till
the
seat
was
worn
thin
a
piece
of
bravado
that
probably
cost
him
dear
for
doubtless
the
exasperated
father's
stick
found
the
attenuated
spot
Since
he
would
have
none
of
the
school
his
father
had
him
apprenticed
out
to
a
tailor
with
the
injunction
not
to
spare
the
rod
But
sitting
cross-legged
on
a
tailor's
stool
did
not
suit
the
lad
and
he
took
it
out
of
his
master
by
snowballing
him
thoroughly
one
winter's
day
Next
a
barber
undertook
to
teach
him
his
trade
but
Peder
ran
away
and
was
drifting
about
the
streets
when
the
King
came
to
Norway
The
boy
saw
the
splendid
uniforms
and
heard
the
story
of
the
beautiful
capital
by
the
Öresund
with
its
palaces
and
great
fighting
ships
When
the
King
departed
he
was
missing
and
for
a
while
there
was
peace
in
Trondhjem
Down
in
Copenhagen
the
homeless
lad
was
found
wandering
about
by
the
King's
chaplain
who
being
himself
a
Norwegian
took
him
home
and
made
him
a
household
page
But
the
boy's
wanderings
had
led
him
to
the
navy-yard
where
he
saw
mid-shipmen
of
his
own
size
at
drill
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
When
he
should
have
been
waiting
at
table
he
was
down
among
the
ships
For
him
there
was
ever
but
one
way
to
any
goal
the
straight
cut
and
at
fifteen
he
wrote
to
the
King
asking
to
be
appointed
a
midshipman
"I
am
wearing
away
my
life
as
a
servant,
he
wrote
"I
want
to
give
it
and
my
blood
to
the
service
of
your
Majesty
and
I
will
serve
you
with
all
my
might
while
I
live!
The
navy
had
need
of
that
kind
of
recruits
and
the
King
saw
to
it
that
he
was
apprenticed
at
once
And
that
was
the
beginning
of
his
strangely
romantic
career
Three
years
he
sailed
before
the
mast
and
learned
seamanship
while
Charles
was
baiting
the
Muscovite
and
the
North
was
resting
on
its
arms
Then
came
Pultava
and
the
Swedish
King's
crushing
defeat
The
storm-centre
was
transferred
to
the
North
again
and
the
war
on
the
sea
opened
with
a
splendid
deed
fit
to
appeal
to
any
ardent
young
heart
At
the
battle
in
the
Bay
of
Kjöge
the
_Dannebrog_
commanded
by
Ivar
Hvitfeldt
caught
fire
and
by
its
position
exposed
the
Danish
fleet
to
great
danger
Hvitfeldt
could
do
one
of
two
things
save
his
own
life
and
his
men's
by
letting
his
ship
drift
before
the
wind
and
by
his
escape
risking
the
rest
of
the
fleet
and
losing
the
battle
or
stay
where
he
was
to
meet
certain
death
He
chose
the
latter
anchored
his
vessel
securely
and
fought
on
until
the
ship
was
burned
down
to
the
water's
edge
and
blew
up
with
him
and
his
five
hundred
men
Ivar
Hvitfeldt's
name
is
forever
immortal
in
the
history
of
his
country
A
few
years
ago
they
raised
the
wreck
of
the
_Dannebrog_
fitly
called
after
the
Danish
flag
and
made
of
its
guns
a
monument
that
stands
on
Langelinie
the
beautiful
shore
road
of
Copenhagen
Fired
by
such
deeds
young
Wessel
implored
the
King
before
he
had
yet
worn
out
his
first
midshipman's
jacket
to
give
him
command
of
a
frigate
He
compromised
on
a
small
privateer
the
_Ormen_
but
with
it
he
did
such
execution
in
Swedish
waters
and
earned
such
renown
as
a
dauntless
sailor
and
a
bold
scout
whose
information
about
the
enemy
was
always
first
and
best
that
before
spring
they
gave
him
a
frigate
with
eighteen
guns
and
the
emphatic
warning
"not
to
engage
any
enemy
when
he
was
not
clearly
the
stronger.
He
immediately
brought
in
a
Swedish
cruiser
the
_Alabama
of
those
days
that
had
been
the
terror
of
the
sea
In
a
naval
battle
in
the
Baltic
soon
after
he
engaged
with
his
little
frigate
two
of
the
enemy's
line-of-battle
ships
that
were
trying
to
get
away
and
only
when
a
third
came
to
help
them
did
he
retreat
so
battered
that
he
had
to
seek
port
to
make
repairs
Accused
of
violating
his
orders
his
answer
was
prompt
"I
promised
your
Majesty
to
do
my
best
and
I
did.
King
Frederik
IV
himself
a
young
and
spirited
man
made
him
a
captain
jumping
him
over
fifty
odd
older
lieutenants
and
gave
him
leave
to
war
on
the
enemy
as
he
saw
fit
The
immediate
result
was
that
the
Governor
of
Göteborg
the
enemy's
chief
seaport
in
the
North
Sea
put
a
price
on
his
head
Captain
Wessel
heard
of
it
and
sent
word
into
town
that
he
was
outside--to
come
and
take
him
but
to
hurry
for
time
was
short
While
waiting
for
a
reply
he
fell
in
with
two
Swedish
men-of-war
having
in
tow
a
Danish
prize
That
was
not
to
be
borne
and
though
they
together
mounted
ninety-four
guns
to
his
eighteen
he
fell
upon
them
like
a
thunderbolt
They
beat
him
off
but
he
returned
for
their
prize
That
time
they
nearly
sank
him
with
three
broad-sides
However
he
ran
for
the
Norwegian
coast
and
saved
his
ship
In
his
report
of
this
affair
he
excuses
himself
for
running
away
with
the
reflection
that
allowing
himself
to
be
sunk
"would
not
rightly
have
benefited
his
Majesty's
service.
However
the
opportunity
came
to
him
swiftly
of
"rightly
benefiting
the
King's
service
After
the
battle
of
Kolberger
Heide
that
had
gone
against
the
Swedes
he
found
them
beaching
their
ships
under
cover
of
the
night
to
prevent
their
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
victors
Wessel
halted
them
with
the
threat
that
every
man
Jack
in
the
fleet
should
be
made
to
walk
the
plank
saved
the
ships
and
took
their
admiral
prisoner
to
his
chief
When
others
slept
Wessel
was
abroad
with
his
swift
sailer
If
wind
and
sea
went
against
him
he
knew
how
to
turn
his
mishap
to
account
Driven
in
under
the
hostile
shore
once
he
took
the
opportunity
as
was
his
wont
to
get
the
lay
of
the
land
and
of
the
enemy
He
learned
quickly
that
in
the
harbor
of
Wesensö
not
far
away
a
Swedish
cutter
was
lying
with
a
Danish
prize
She
carried
eight
guns
and
had
a
crew
of
thirty-six
men
but
though
he
had
at
the
moment
only
eighteen
sailors
in
his
boat
he
crept
up
the
coast
at
once
slipped
quietly
in
after
sundown
and
took
ship
and
prize
with
a
rush
killing
and
throwing
overboard
such
as
resisted
In
Sweden
mothers
hushed
their
crying
children
with
his
dreaded
name
on
the
sea
they
came
near
to
thinking
him
a
troll
so
sudden
and
unexpected
were
his
onsets
But
there
was
no
witchcraft
about
it
He
sailed
swiftly
because
he
was
a
skilled
sailor
and
because
he
missed
no
opportunity
to
have
the
bottom
of
his
ship
scraped
and
greased
And
when
on
board
pistol
and
cutlass
hung
loose
for
it
was
a
time
of
war
with
a
brave
and
relentless
foe
His
reconnoitring
expeditions
he
always
headed
himself
and
sometimes
he
went
alone
Thus
when
getting
ready
to
take
Marstrand
a
fortified
seaport
of
great
importance
to
Charles
he
went
ashore
disguised
as
a
fisherman
and
peddled
fish
through
the
town
even
in
the
very
castle
itself
where
he
took
notice
along
with
the
position
of
the
guns
and
the
strength
of
the
garrison
of
the
fact
that
the
commandant
had
two
pretty
daughters
He
was
a
sailor
sure
enough
Once
when
ashore
on
such
an
expedition
he
was
surprised
by
a
company
of
dragoons
His
men
escaped
but
the
dragoons
cut
off
his
way
to
the
shore
As
they
rode
at
him
reaching
out
for
his
sword
he
suddenly
dashed
among
them
cut
one
down
and
diving
through
the
surf
swam
out
to
the
boat
his
sword
between
his
teeth
Their
bullets
churned
up
the
sea
all
about
him
but
he
was
not
hit
He
seemed
to
bear
a
charmed
life
in
all
his
fights
he
was
wounded
but
once
That
was
in
the
attack
on
the
strongly
fortified
port
of
Strömstad
in
which
he
was
repulsed
with
a
loss
of
9
killed
and
24
wounded
while
the
Swedish
loss
footed
up
over
1500
a
fight
which
led
straight
to
the
most
astonishing
chapter
in
his
whole
career
of
which
more
anon
All
Denmark
and
Norway
presently
rang
with
the
stories
of
his
exploits
They
were
always
of
the
kind
to
appeal
to
the
imagination
for
in
truth
he
was
a
very
knight
errant
of
the
sea
who
fought
for
the
love
of
it
as
well
as
of
the
flag
ardent
patriot
that
he
was
A
brave
and
chivalrous
foe
he
loved
next
to
a
loyal
friend
Cowardice
he
loathed
Once
when
ordered
to
follow
a
retreating
enemy
with
his
frigate
_Hvide
Örnen
(the
White
Eagle
of
thirty
guns
he
hugged
him
so
close
that
in
the
darkness
he
ran
his
ship
into
the
great
Swedish
man-of-war
_Ösel
of
sixty-four
guns
The
chance
was
too
good
to
let
pass
Seeing
that
the
_Ösel's
lower
gun-ports
were
closed
and
reasoning
from
this
that
she
had
been
struck
in
the
water-line
and
badly
damaged
he
was
for
boarding
her
at
once
but
his
men
refused
to
follow
him
In
the
delay
the
_Ösel
backed
away
Captain
Wessel
gave
chase
pelted
her
with
shot
and
called
to
her
captain
whose
name
was
_Söstjerna
(sea-star)
to
stop
"Running
away
from
a
frigate
are
you
Shame
on
you
coward
and
poltroon
Stay
and
fight
like
a
man
for
your
King
and
your
flag!
Seeing
him
edge
yet
farther
away
he
shouted
in
utter
exasperation
"Your
name
shall
be
dog-star
forever
not
sea-star
if
you
don't
stay.
"But
all
this,
he
wrote
sadly
to
the
King
"with
much
more
which
was
worse
had
no
effect.
However
on
his
way
back
to
join
the
fleet
he
ran
across
a
convoy
of
ten
merchant
vessels
guarded
by
three
of
the
enemy's
line-of-battle
ships
He
made
a
feint
at
passing
but
suddenly
turning
swooped
down
upon
the
biggest
trader
ran
out
his
boats
made
fast
and
towed
it
away
from
under
the
very
noses
of
its
protectors
It
meant
prize-money
for
his
men
but
their
captain
did
not
forget
their
craven
conduct
of
the
night
which
had
made
him
lose
a
bigger
prize
and
with
the
money
they
got
a
sound
flogging
The
account
of
the
duel
between
his
first
frigate
_Lövendahl's
Galley_
of
eighteen
guns
and
a
Swede
of
twenty-eight
guns
reads
like
the
doings
of
the
old
vikings
and
indeed
both
commanders
were
likely
descended
straight
from
those
arch
fighters
Wessel
certainly
was
The
other
captain
was
an
English
officer
Bactman
by
name
who
was
on
the
way
to
deliver
his
ship
that
had
been
bought
in
England
to
the
Swedes
They
met
in
the
North
Sea
and
fell
to
fighting
by
noon
of
one
day
The
afternoon
of
the
next
saw
them
at
it
yet
Twice
the
crew
of
the
Swedish
frigate
had
thrown
down
their
arms
refusing
to
fight
any
more
Vainly
the
vessel
had
tried
to
get
away
the
Dane
hung
to
it
like
a
leech
In
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
Wessel
was
informed
that
his
powder
had
given
out
He
had
a
boat
sent
out
with
a
herald
who
presented
to
Captain
Bactman
his
regrets
that
he
had
to
quit
for
lack
of
powder
but
would
he
come
aboard
and
shake
hands
The
Briton
declined
Meanwhile
the
ships
had
drifted
close
enough
to
speak
through
the
trumpet
and
Captain
Wessel
shouted
over
from
his
quarter-deck
that
"if
he
could
lend
him
a
little
powder
they
might
still
go
on.
Captain
Bactman
smilingly
shook
his
head
and
then
the
two
drank
to
one
another's
health
each
on
his
own
quarter-deck
and
parted
friends
while
their
crews
manned
what
was
left
of
the
yards
and
cheered
each
other
wildly
Wessel's
enemies
of
whom
he
had
many
especially
among
the
nobility
who
looked
upon
him
as
a
vulgar
upstart
used
this
incident
to
bring
him
before
a
court-martial
It
was
unpatriotic
they
declared
and
they
demanded
that
he
be
degraded
and
fined
His
defence
which
with
all
the
records
of
his
career
are
in
the
Navy
Department
at
Copenhagen
was
brief
but
to
the
point
It
is
summed
up
in
the
retort
to
his
accusers
that
"they
themselves
should
be
rebuked
and
severely
for
failing
to
understand
that
an
officer
in
the
King's
service
should
be
promoted
instead
of
censured
for
doing
his
plain
duty,
and
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
articles
of
war
commanding
him
to
treat
an
honorable
foe
otherwise
than
with
honor
It
must
be
admitted
that
he
gave
his
critics
no
lack
of
cause
His
enterprises
were
often
enough
of
a
hair-raising
kind
and
he
had
scant
patience
with
censure
Thus
once
when
harassed
by
an
Admiralty
order
purposely
issued
to
annoy
him
he
wrote
back
"The
biggest
fool
can
see
that
to
obey
would
defeat
all
my
plans
I
shall
not
do
it
It
may
suit
folk
who
love
loafing
about
shore
but
to
an
honest
man
such
talk
is
disgusting
let
alone
that
the
thing
can't
be
done.
He
was
at
that
time
twenty-six
years
old
and
in
charge
of
the
whole
North
Sea
fleet
No
wonder
he
had
enemies
However
the
King
was
his
friend
He
made
him
a
nobleman
and
gave
him
the
name
Tordenskjold
It
means
"thunder
shield.
"Then
by
the
powers,
he
swore
when
he
was
told
"I
shall
thunder
in
the
ears
of
the
Swedes
so
that
the
King
shall
hear
of
it!
And
he
kept
his
word
Charles
had
determined
to
take
Denmark
with
one
fell
blow
He
had
an
army
assembled
in
Skaane
to
cross
the
sound
which
was
frozen
over
solid
All
was
ready
for
the
invasion
in
January
1716
The
people
throughout
Sweden
had
assembled
in
the
churches
to
pray
for
the
success
of
the
King's
arms
and
he
was
there
himself
to
lead
but
in
the
early
morning
hours
a
strong
east
wind
broke
up
the
ice
and
the
campaign
ended
before
it
was
begun
Charles
then
turned
on
Norway
and
laid
siege
to
the
city
of
Frederikshald
which
with
its
strong
fort
Frederiksteen
was
the
key
to
that
country
A
Danish
fleet
lay
in
the
Skagerak
blocking
his
way
of
reënforcements
by
sea
Tordenskjold
with
his
frigate
_Hvide
Örnen_
and
six
smaller
ships
(the
frigate
_Vindhunden
of
sixteen
guns
and
five
vessels
of
light
draught
two
of
which
were
heavily
armed)
was
doing
scouting
duty
for
the
Admiral
when
he
learned
that
the
entire
Swedish
fleet
of
forty-four
ships
that
was
intended
to
aid
in
the
operations
against
Frederikshald
lay
in
the
harbor
of
Dynekilen
waiting
its
chance
to
slip
out
It
was
so
well
shielded
there
that
its
commander
sent
word
to
the
King
to
rest
easy
nothing
could
happen
to
him
He
would
join
him
presently
Tordenskjold
saw
that
if
he
could
capture
or
destroy
this
fleet
Norway
was
saved
the
siege
must
perforce
be
abandoned
And
Norway
was
his
native
land
which
he
loved
with
his
whole
fervid
soul
But
no
time
was
to
be
lost
He
could
not
go
back
to
ask
for
permission
and
one
may
shrewdly
guess
that
he
did
not
want
to
for
it
would
certainly
have
been
refused
He
heard
that
the
Swedish
officers
secure
in
their
stronghold
were
to
attend
a
wedding
on
shore
the
next
day
His
instructions
from
the
Admiralty
were
in
an
emergency
always
to
hold
a
council
of
war
and
to
abide
by
its
decision
At
daybreak
he
ran
his
ship
alongside
_Vindhunden_
her
companion
frigate
and
called
to
the
captain
"The
Swedish
officers
are
bidden
to
a
wedding
and
they
have
forgotten
us
What
do
you
say--shall
we
go
unasked?
Captain
Grip
was
game
"Good
enough!
he
shouted
back
"The
wind
is
fair
and
we
have
all
day
I
am
ready.
That
was
the
council
of
war
and
its
decision
Tordenskjold
gave
the
signal
to
clear
for
action
and
sailed
in
at
the
head
of
his
handful
of
ships
The
inlet
to
the
harbor
of
Dynekilen
is
narrow
and
crooked
winding
between
reefs
and
rocky
steeps
quite
two
miles
and
only
in
spots
more
than
four
hundred
feet
wide
Halfway
in
was
a
strong
battery
Tordenskjold's
fleet
was
received
with
a
tremendous
fire
from
all
the
Swedish
ships
from
the
battery
and
from
an
army
of
four
thousand
soldiers
lying
along
shore
The
Danish
ships
made
no
reply
They
sailed
up
grimly
silent
till
they
reached
a
place
wide
enough
to
let
them
wear
round
broadside
on
Then
their
guns
spoke
Three
hours
the
battle
raged
before
the
Swedish
fire
began
to
slacken
As
soon
as
he
noticed
it
Tordenskjold
slipped
into
the
inner
harbor
under
cover
of
the
heavy
pall
of
smoke
and
before
the
Swedes
suspected
their
presence
they
found
his
ships
alongside
Broadside
after
broadside
crashed
into
them
and
in
terror
they
fled
soldiers
and
sailors
alike
While
they
ran
Tordenskjold
swooped
down
upon
the
half-way
battery
seized
it
and
spiked
its
guns
The
fight
was
won
But
the
heaviest
part
was
left--the
towing
out
of
the
captured
ships
All
the
afternoon
Tordenskjold
led
the
work
in
person
pulling
on
ropes
cheering
on
his
men
The
Swedes
returning
gamely
to
the
fight
showered
them
with
bullets
from
shore
One
of
the
abandoned
vessels
caught
fire
Lieutenant
Tönder
of
Tordenskjold's
staff
a
veteran
with
a
wooden
leg
boarded
it
just
as
the
quartermaster
ran
up
yelling
that
the
ship
was
full
of
powder
and
was
going
to
blow
up
He
tried
to
jump
overboard
but
the
lieutenant
seized
him
by
the
collar
and
stumping
along
made
him
lead
the
way
to
the
magazine
A
fuse
had
been
laid
to
an
open
keg
of
powder
and
the
fire
was
sputtering
within
an
inch
of
it
when
Lieutenant
Tönder
plucked
it
out
smothered
it
between
thumb
and
forefinger
and
threw
it
through
the
nearest
port-hole
There
were
two
hundred
barrels
of
powder
in
the
ship
Tordenskjold
had
kept
his
word
to
the
King
Not
as
much
as
a
yawl
of
the
Dynekilen
fleet
was
left
to
the
enemy
He
had
sunk
or
burned
thirteen
and
captured
thirty-one
ships
with
his
seven
and
all
the
piled-up
munitions
of
war
were
in
his
hands
King
Charles
gave
up
the
siege
marched
his
army
out
of
Norway
and
the
country
was
saved
The
victory
cost
Tordenskjold
but
nineteen
killed
and
fifty-seven
wounded
On
his
own
ship
six
men
were
killed
and
twenty
wounded
Of
infinite
variety
was
this
sea-fighter
After
a
victory
like
this
one
hears
of
him
in
the
next
breath
gratifying
a
passing
whim
of
the
King
who
wanted
to
know
what
the
Swedish
people
thought
of
their
Government
after
Charles's
long
wars
that
are
said
to
have
cost
their
country
a
million
men
Tordenskjold
overheard
it
had
himself
rowed
across
to
Sweden
picked
up
there
a
wedding
party
bridegroom
minister
guests
and
all
including
the
captain
of
the
shore
watch
who
was
among
them
and
returned
in
time
for
the
palace
dinner
with
his
catch
King
Frederik
was
entertaining
Czar
Peter
the
Great
who
had
been
boasting
of
the
unhesitating
loyalty
of
his
men
which
his
Danish
host
could
not
match
He
now
had
the
tables
turned
upon
him
It
is
recorded
that
the
King
sent
the
party
back
with
royal
gifts
for
the
bride
One
would
be
glad
to
add
that
Tordenskjold
sent
back
too
the
silver
pitcher
and
the
parlor
clock
his
men
took
on
their
visit
But
he
didn't
They
were
still
in
Copenhagen
a
hundred
years
later
and
may
be
they
are
yet
It
was
not
like
his
usual
gallantry
toward
the
fair
sex
But
perhaps
he
didn't
know
anything
about
it
Then
we
find
him
after
an
unsuccessful
attack
on
Göteborg
that
cost
many
lives
sending
in
his
adjutant
to
congratulate
the
Swedish
commandant
on
their
"gallant
encounter
the
day
before
and
exchanging
presents
with
him
in
token
of
mutual
regard
And
before
one
can
turn
the
page
he
is
discovered
swooping
down
upon
Marstrand
taking
town
and
fleet
anchored
there
and
the
castle
itself
with
its
whole
garrison
all
with
two
hundred
men
swelled
by
stratagem
into
an
army
of
thousands
We
are
told
that
an
officer
sent
out
from
the
castle
to
parley
issuing
forth
from
a
generous
dinner
beheld
the
besieging
army
drawn
up
in
street
after
street
always
two
hundred
men
around
every
corner
as
he
made
his
way
through
the
town
piloted
by
Tordenskjold
himself
who
was
careful
to
take
him
the
longest
way
while
the
men
took
the
short
cut
to
the
next
block
The
man
returned
home
with
the
message
that
the
town
was
full
of
them
and
that
resistance
was
useless
The
ruse
smacks
of
Peder
Wessel's
boyish
fight
with
a
much
bigger
fellow
who
had
beaten
him
once
by
gripping
his
long
hair
and
so
getting
his
head
in
chancery
But
Peder
had
taken
notice
Next
time
he
came
to
the
encounter
with
hair
cut
short
and
his
whole
head
smeared
with
soft-soap
and
that
time
he
won
The
most
extraordinary
of
all
his
adventures
befell
when
after
the
attack
on
Strömstad
he
was
hastening
home
to
Copenhagen
Crossing
the
Kattegat
in
a
little
smack
that
carried
but
two
three-pound
guns
he
was
chased
and
overtaken
by
a
Swedish
frigate
of
sixteen
guns
and
a
crew
of
sixty
men
Tordenskjold
had
but
twenty-one
and
eight
of
them
were
servants
and
non-combatants
They
were
dreadfully
frightened
and
tradition
has
it
that
one
of
them
wept
when
he
saw
the
Swede
coming
on
Her
captain
called
upon
him
to
surrender
but
the
answer
was
flung
back
"I
am
Tordenskjold
Come
and
take
me
if
you
can.
With
that
came
a
tiny
broadside
that
did
brisk
execution
on
the
frigate
Tordenskjold
had
hauled
both
his
guns
over
on
the
"fighting
side
of
his
vessel
There
ensued
a
battle
such
as
Homer
would
have
loved
to
sing
Both
sides
banged
away
for
all
they
were
worth
In
the
midst
of
the
din
and
smoke
Tordenskjold
used
his
musket
with
cool
skill
his
servants
loaded
while
he
fired
At
every
shot
a
man
fell
on
the
frigate
Word
was
brought
that
there
was
no
more
round
shot
He
bade
them
twist
up
his
pewter
dinner
service
and
fire
that
which
they
did
The
Swede
tried
vainly
to
board
Tordenskjold
manoeuvred
his
smack
with
such
skill
that
they
could
not
hook
on
Seeing
this
Captain
Lind
commander
of
the
frigate
called
to
him
to
desist
from
the
useless
struggle
he
would
be
honored
to
carry
such
a
prisoner
into
Göteborg
Back
came
the
taunt
"Neither
you
nor
any
other
Swede
shall
ever
carry
me
there!
And
with
that
he
shot
the
captain
down.[1
[Footnote
1
He
was
not
mortally
wounded
and
Tordenskjold
took
him
prisoner
later
at
the
capture
of
Marstrand.
When
his
men
saw
him
fall
they
were
seized
with
panic
and
made
off
as
quickly
as
they
could
while
Tordenskjold's
crew
of
whom
only
fourteen
were
left
beat
their
drums
and
blew
trumpets
in
frantic
defiance
Their
captain
was
for
following
the
Swede
and
boarding
her
but
he
couldn't
Sails
rigging
and
masts
were
shot
to
pieces
Perhaps
the
terror
of
the
Swedes
was
increased
by
the
sight
of
Tordenskjold's
tame
bear
making
faces
at
them
behind
his
master
It
went
with
him
everywhere
till
that
day
and
came
out
of
the
fight
unscathed
But
during
the
night
the
crew
ran
the
vessel
on
the
Swedish
shore
whence
Tordenskjold
himself
reached
Denmark
in
an
open
boat
which
he
had
to
keep
bailing
all
night
for
the
boat
was
shot
full
of
holes
and
though
he
and
his
companions
stuffed
their
spare
clothing
into
them
it
leaked
badly
The
enemy
got
the
smack
after
all
and
the
bear
which
being
a
Norwegian
proved
so
untractable
on
Swedish
soil
that
sad
to
relate
in
the
end
they
cut
him
up
and
ate
him
King
Charles
himself
a
knightly
soul
and
an
admirer
of
a
gallant
enemy
gave
orders
to
have
all
Tordenskjold's
belongings
sent
back
to
him
but
he
did
not
live
to
see
the
order
carried
out
He
was
found
dead
in
the
rifle-pits
before
Frederiksteen
on
December
11
1718
shot
through
the
head
It
was
Tordenskjold
himself
who
brought
the
all-important
news
to
King
Frederik
in
the
night
of
December
28,--they
were
not
the
days
of
telegraphs
and
fast
steamers,--and
when
the
King
who
had
been
roused
out
of
bed
to
receive
him
could
not
trust
his
ears
he
said
with
characteristic
audacity
"I
wish
it
were
as
true
that
your
Majesty
had
made
me
a
schoutbynacht,"--the
rank
next
below
admiral
And
so
he
took
the
step
next
to
the
last
on
the
ladder
of
his
ambition
Within
seven
months
he
took
Marstrand
It
is
part
of
the
record
of
that
astonishing
performance
that
when
the
unhappy
Commandant
hesitated
as
the
hour
of
evacuation
came
not
sure
that
he
had
done
right
in
capitulating
Tordenskjold
walked
up
to
the
fort
with
a
hundred
men
half
his
force
banged
on
the
gate
went
in
alone
and
up
to
the
Commandant's
window
thundering
out
"What
are
you
waiting
for
Don't
you
know
time
is
up?
In
terror
and
haste
Colonel
Dankwardt
moved
his
Hessians
out
and
Tordenskjold
marched
his
handful
of
men
in
When
he
brought
the
King
the
keys
of
Marstrand
Frederik
made
him
an
admiral
It
was
while
blockading
the
port
of
Göteborg
in
the
last
year
of
the
war
that
he
met
and
made
a
friend
of
Lord
Carteret
the
English
Ambassador
to
Denmark
and
fell
in
love
with
the
picture
of
a
young
Englishwoman
Miss
Norris
a
lady
of
great
beauty
and
wealth
who
Lord
Carteret
told
him
was
an
ardent
admirer
of
his
It
was
this
love
which
indirectly
sent
him
to
his
death
Lord
Carteret
had
given
him
a
picture
of
her
and
as
soon
as
peace
was
made
he
started
for
England
but
he
never
reached
that
country
The
remnant
of
the
Swedish
fleet
lay
in
the
roadstead
at
Göteborg
under
the
guns
of
the
two
forts
New
and
Old
Elfsborg
While
Tordenskjold
was
away
at
Marstrand
the
enemy
sallied
forth
and
snapped
up
seven
of
the
smaller
vessels
of
his
blockading
fleet
The
news
made
him
furious
He
sent
in
demanding
them
back
at
once
"or
I
will
come
after
them.
He
had
already
made
one
ineffectual
attempt
to
take
New
Elfsborg
that
cost
him
dear
In
Göteborg
they
knew
the
strength
of
his
fleet
and
laughed
at
his
threat
But
it
was
never
safe
to
laugh
at
Tordenskjold
The
first
dark
night
he
stole
in
with
ten
armed
boats
seized
the
shore
batteries
of
the
old
fort
and
spiked
their
guns
before
a
shot
was
fired
The
rising
moon
saw
his
men
in
possession
of
the
ships
lying
at
anchor
With
their
blue-lined
coats
turned
inside
out
so
that
they
might
pass
for
Swedish
uniforms
they
surprised
the
watch
in
the
guard-house
and
made
them
all
prisoners
Now
that
there
was
no
longer
reason
for
caution
they
raised
a
racket
that
woke
the
sleeping
town
up
in
a
fright
The
commander
of
the
other
fort
sent
out
a
boat
to
ascertain
the
cause
It
met
the
Admiral's
and
challenged
it
"Who
goes
there?
"Tordenskjold,
was
the
reply
"come
to
teach
you
to
keep
awake.
It
proved
impossible
to
warp
the
ships
out
Only
one
of
the
seven
lost
ones
was
recovered
all
the
rest
were
set
on
fire
By
the
light
of
the
mighty
bonfire
Tordenskjold
rowed
out
with
his
men
hauling
the
recovered
ship
right
under
the
guns
of
the
forts
the
Danish
flag
flying
at
the
bow
of
his
boat
He
had
not
lost
a
single
man
A
cannon-ball
swept
away
all
the
oars
on
one
side
of
his
boat
but
no
one
was
hurt
At
Marstrand
they
had
been
up
all
night
listening
to
the
cannonading
and
the
crash
upon
crash
as
the
big
ships
blew
up
They
knew
that
Tordenskjold
was
abroad
with
his
men
In
the
morning
when
they
were
all
in
church
he
walked
in
and
sat
down
by
his
chief
the
old
Admiral
Judicher
who
was
a
slow-going
cautious
man
He
whispered
anxiously
"What
news?
but
Tordenskjold
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
unmoved
face
It
is
not
likely
that
either
the
old
Admiral
or
the
congregation
heard
much
of
that
sermon
if
indeed
they
heard
any
of
it
But
when
it
was
over
they
saw
from
the
walls
of
the
town
the
Danish
ships
at
anchor
and
heard
the
story
of
the
last
of
Tordenskjold's
exploits
It
fitly
capped
the
climax
of
his
life
Sweden's
entire
force
on
the
North
Sea
with
the
exception
of
five
small
galleys
had
either
been
captured
sunk
or
burned
by
him
The
King
would
not
let
Tordenskjold
go
when
peace
was
made
but
he
had
his
way
in
the
end
To
his
undoing
he
consented
to
take
with
him
abroad
a
young
scalawag
the
son
of
his
landlord
who
had
more
money
than
brains
In
Hamburg
the
young
man
fell
in
with
a
gambler
a
Swedish
colonel
by
name
of
Stahl
who
fleeced
him
of
all
he
had
and
much
more
besides
When
Tordenskjold
heard
of
it
and
met
the
Colonel
in
another
man's
house
he
caned
him
soundly
and
threw
him
out
in
the
street
For
this
he
was
challenged
but
refused
to
fight
a
gambler
"Friends,
particularly
one
Colonel
Münnichhausen
who
volunteered
to
be
his
second
talked
him
over
and
also
persuaded
him
to
give
up
the
pistol
with
which
he
was
an
expert
The
duel
was
fought
at
the
Village
of
Gledinge
over
the
line
from
Hanover
on
the
morning
of
November
12
1720
Tordenskjold
was
roused
from
sleep
at
five
and
after
saying
his
prayers
a
duty
he
never
on
any
account
omitted
he
started
for
the
place
appointed
His
old
body-servant
vainly
pleaded
with
his
master
to
take
his
stout
blade
instead
of
the
flimsy
parade
sword
the
Admiral
carried
Münnichhausen
advised
against
it
it
would
be
too
heavy
he
said
Stahl's
weapon
was
a
long
fighting
rapier
and
to
this
the
treacherous
second
made
no
objection
Almost
at
the
first
thrust
he
ran
the
Admiral
through
The
seconds
held
his
servant
while
Stahl
jumped
on
his
horse
and
galloped
away
Tordenskjold
breathed
out
his
dauntless
soul
in
the
arms
of
his
faithful
servant
and
friend
His
body
lies
in
a
black
marble
sarcophagus
in
the
"Navy
Church
at
Copenhagen
The
Danish
and
Norwegian
peoples
have
never
ceased
to
mourn
their
idol
He
was
a
sailor
with
a
sailor's
faults
But
he
loved
truth
honor
and
courage
in
foe
and
friend
alike
Like
many
seafaring
men
he
was
deeply
religious
with
the
unquestioning
faith
of
a
child
There
is
a
letter
in
existence
written
by
him
to
his
father
when
the
latter
was
on
his
death-bed
that
bears
witness
to
this
He
thanks
him
with
filial
affection
for
all
his
care
and
says
naïvely
that
he
would
rather
have
his
prayers
than
fall
heir
to
twenty
thousand
daler
His
pictures
show
a
stocky
broad-shouldered
youth
with
frank
blue
eyes
full
lips
and
an
eagle
nose
His
deep
sonorous
voice
used
to
be
heard
in
his
midshipman
days
above
the
whole
congregation
in
the
Navy
Church
In
after
years
it
called
louder
still
to
Denmark's
foes
When
things
were
at
their
worst
in
storm
or
battle
he
was
wont
to
shout
to
his
men
"Hi
_now
we
are
having
a
fine
time!
and
his
battle-cry
has
passed
into
the
language
By
it
in
desperate
straits
demanding
stout
hearts
one
may
know
the
Dane
after
his
own
heart
the
real
Dane
the
world
over
Among
his
own
Tordenskjold
is
still
and
always
will
be
"the
Admiral
of
Norway's
fleet.
HANS
EGEDE
THE
APOSTLE
TO
GREENLAND
When
in
the
fall
of
190
the
statement
was
flashed
around
the
world
that
the
North
Pole
had
at
last
been
reached
a
name
long
unfamiliar
ran
from
mouth
to
mouth
with
that
of
the
man
who
claimed
to
be
its
discoverer
Dr
Cook
was
coming
to
Copenhagen
the
daily
despatches
read
on
the
Danish
Government
steamer
_Hans
Egede_
A
shipload
of
reporters
kept
an
anxious
lookout
from
the
Skaw
for
the
vessel
so
suddenly
become
famous
but
few
who
through
their
telescopes
made
out
the
name
at
last
upon
the
prow
of
the
ship
gave
it
another
thought
in
the
eager
welcome
to
the
man
it
brought
back
from
the
perils
of
the
Farthest
North
Yet
the
name
of
that
vessel
stood
for
something
of
more
real
account
to
humanity
than
the
attainment
of
a
goal
that
had
been
the
mystery
of
the
ages
No
such
welcome
awaited
the
explorer
Hans
Egede
who
a
hundred
and
seventy-two
years
before
sailed
homeward
over
that
very
route
a
broken
saddened
man
and
all
he
brought
was
the
ashes
of
his
best-beloved
that
they
might
rest
in
her
native
soil
No
gold
medal
was
struck
for
him
the
people
did
not
greet
him
with
loud
acclaim
The
King
and
his
court
paid
scant
attention
to
him
and
he
was
allowed
to
live
his
last
days
in
poverty
Yet
a
greater
honor
is
his
than
ever
fell
to
a
discoverer
the
simple
natives
of
Greenland
long
reckoned
the
time
from
his
coming
among
them
To
them
he
was
in
their
ice-bound
home
what
Father
Damien
was
to
the
stricken
lepers
in
the
South
seas
and
Dr
Grenfell
is
to
the
fishermen
of
Labrador
Hans
Poulsen
Egede
the
apostle
of
Greenland
was
a
Norwegian
of
Danish
descent
He
was
born
in
the
Northlands
in
the
parish
of
Trondenäs
on
January
31
1686
His
grandfather
and
his
father
before
him
had
been
clergymen
in
Denmark
the
former
in
the
town
of
West
Egede
whence
the
name
Graduated
in
a
single
year
from
the
University
of
Copenhagen
"at
which,
his
teachers
bore
witness
"no
one
need
wonder
who
knows
the
man,
he
became
at
twenty-two
pastor
of
a
parish
up
in
the
Lofoden
Islands
where
the
fabled
maëlstrom
churns
Eleven
years
he
preached
to
the
poor
fisherfolk
on
Sunday
and
on
week-days
helped
his
parishioners
rebuild
the
old
church
When
it
was
finished
and
the
bishop
came
to
consecrate
it
he
chided
Egede
because
the
altar
was
too
fine
it
must
have
cost
more
than
they
could
afford
"It
did
not
cost
anything,
was
his
reply
"I
made
it
myself.
No
wonder
his
fame
went
far
When
the
church
bell
of
Vaagen
called
boats
carrying
Sunday-clad
fishermen
were
seen
making
for
the
island
from
every
point
of
the
compass
Great
crowds
flocked
to
his
church
great
enough
to
arouse
the
jealousy
of
neighboring
preachers
who
were
not
so
popular
and
they
made
it
so
unpleasant
that
his
wife
at
last
tired
of
it
They
little
dreamed
that
they
were
industriously
paving
the
way
for
his
greater
work
and
for
his
undying
fame
The
sea
that
surges
against
that
rockbound
coast
ever
called
its
people
out
in
quest
of
adventure
Some
who
went
nine
hundred
years
ago
found
a
land
in
the
far
Northwest
barred
by
great
icebergs
but
once
inside
the
barrier
they
saw
deep
fjords
like
their
own
at
home
to
which
the
mountains
sloped
down
covered
with
a
wealth
of
lovely
flowers
On
green
meadows
antlered
deer
were
grazing
the
salmon
leaped
in
brawling
brooks
and
birds
called
for
their
mates
in
the
barrens
Above
it
all
towered
snow-covered
peaks
They
saw
only
the
summer
day
they
did
not
know
how
brief
it
was
and
how
long
the
winter
night
and
they
called
the
country
Greenland
They
built
their
homes
there
and
other
settlers
came
They
were
hardy
men
bred
in
a
harsh
climate
and
they
stayed
They
built
churches
and
had
their
priests
and
bishops
for
Norway
was
Christian
by
that
time
And
they
prospered
after
their
fashion
They
even
paid
Peter's
Pence
to
Rome
There
is
a
record
that
their
contribution
being
in
kind
namely
walrus
teeth
was
sold
in
138
by
the
Pope's
agent
to
a
merchant
in
Flanders
for
twelve
livres
fourteen
sous
They
kept
up
communication
with
their
kin
across
the
seas
until
the
Black
Death
swept
through
the
Old
World
in
the
Fourteenth
Century
Norway
when
it
was
gone
was
like
a
vast
tomb
Two-thirds
of
its
people
lay
dead
Those
who
were
left
had
enough
to
do
at
home
and
Greenland
was
forgotten
The
seasons
passed
and
the
savages
with
whom
the
colonists
had
carried
on
a
running
feud
came
out
of
the
frozen
North
and
overwhelmed
them
Dim
traditions
that
were
whispered
among
the
natives
for
centuries
told
of
that
last
fight
It
was
the
Ragnarok
of
the
Northmen
Not
one
was
left
to
tell
the
tale
Long
years
after
when
fishing
vessels
landed
on
that
desolate
coast
they
found
a
strange
and
hostile
people
in
possession
No
one
had
ever
dared
to
settle
there
since
This
last
Egede
knew
but
little
more
He
believed
that
there
were
still
settlements
on
the
inaccessible
east
coast
of
Greenland
where
descendants
of
the
old
Northmen
lived
cut
off
from
all
the
world
sunk
into
ignorance
and
godlessness,--men
and
women
who
had
once
known
the
true
light,--and
his
heart
yearned
to
go
to
their
rescue
Waking
and
dreaming
he
thought
of
nothing
else
The
lamp
in
his
quiet
study
shone
out
over
the
sea
at
night
when
his
people
were
long
asleep
Their
pastor
was
poring
over
old
manuscripts
and
the
logs
of
whalers
that
had
touched
upon
Greenland
From
Bergen
he
gathered
the
testimony
of
many
sailors
None
of
them
had
ever
seen
traces
of
or
heard
of
the
old
Northmen
To
his
bishop
went
Egede
with
his
burden
Ever
it
rang
in
his
ears
"God
has
chosen
you
to
bring
them
back
to
the
light.
The
bishop
listened
and
was
interested
Yes
that
was
the
land
from
which
seafarers
in
a
former
king's
time
had
brought
home
golden
sand
There
might
be
more
It
couldn't
be
far
from
Cuba
and
Hispaniola
those
golden
coasts
If
one
were
to
go
equipped
for
trading
no
doubt
a
fine
stroke
of
business
might
be
done
Thus
the
Right
Reverend
Bishop
Krog
of
Trondhjem
and
Egede
went
home
disheartened
At
home
his
friends
scouted
him
said
he
was
going
mad
to
think
of
giving
up
his
living
on
such
a
fool's
chase
His
wife
implored
him
to
stay
and
with
a
heavy
heart
Egede
was
about
to
abandon
his
purpose
when
his
jealous
neighbor
whose
parishioners
had
been
going
to
hear
Egede
preach
stirred
up
such
trouble
that
his
wife
was
glad
to
go
She
even
urged
him
to
and
he
took
her
at
her
word
They
moved
to
Bergen
and
from
that
port
they
sailed
on
May
3
1721
on
the
ship
_Haabet
(the
Hope)
with
another
and
smaller
vessel
as
convoy
forty-six
souls
all
told
bound
for
the
unknown
North
The
Danish
King
had
made
Egede
missionary
to
the
Greenlanders
on
a
salary
of
three
hundred
daler
a
year
the
same
amount
which
Egede
himself
contributed
of
his
scant
store
toward
the
equipment
The
bishop's
plan
had
prevailed
the
mission
was
to
be
carried
by
the
expected
commerce
and
upon
that
was
to
be
built
a
permanent
colonization
Early
in
June
they
sighted
land
but
the
way
to
it
was
barred
by
impassable
ice
A
whole
month
they
sailed
to
and
fro
trying
vainly
for
a
passage
At
last
they
found
an
opening
and
slipped
through
only
to
find
themselves
shut
in
with
towering
icebergs
closing
around
them
As
they
looked
fearfully
out
over
the
rail
their
convoy
signalled
that
she
had
struck
and
the
captain
of
_Haabet
cried
out
that
all
was
lost
In
the
tumult
of
terror
that
succeeded
Egede
alone
remained
calm
Praying
for
succor
where
there
seemed
to
be
none
he
remembered
the
One
Hundred
and
Seventh
Psalm
"He
brought
them
out
of
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death
and
brake
their
bands
in
sunder.
And
the
morning
dawned
clear
the
ice
was
moving
and
their
prison
widening
On
July
3
_Haabet
cleared
the
last
ice-reef
and
the
shore
lay
open
before
them
The
Eskimos
came
out
in
their
kayaks
and
the
boldest
climbed
aboard
the
ship
In
one
boat
sat
an
old
man
who
refused
the
invitation
He
paddled
about
the
vessel
mumbling
darkly
in
a
strange
tongue
He
was
an
Angekok
one
of
the
native
medicine-men
of
whom
presently
Egede
was
to
know
much
more
As
he
stood
upon
the
deck
and
looked
at
these
strangers
for
whose
salvation
he
had
risked
all
his
heart
fell
They
were
not
the
stalwart
Northmen
he
had
looked
for
and
their
jargon
had
no
homelike
sound
But
a
great
wave
of
pity
swept
over
him
and
the
prayer
that
rose
to
his
lips
was
for
strength
to
be
their
friend
and
their
guide
to
the
light
Not
at
once
did
the
way
open
for
the
coveted
friendship
with
the
Eskimos
While
they
thought
the
strangers
came
only
to
trade
they
were
hospitable
enough
but
when
they
saw
them
build
clearly
intent
on
staying
they
made
signs
that
they
had
better
go
They
pointed
to
the
sun
that
sank
lower
toward
the
horizon
every
day
and
shivered
as
if
from
extreme
cold
and
they
showed
their
visitors
the
icebergs
and
the
snow
making
them
understand
that
it
would
cover
the
house
by
and
by
When
it
all
availed
nothing
and
the
winter
came
on
they
retired
into
their
huts
and
cut
the
acquaintance
of
the
white
men
They
were
afraid
that
they
had
come
to
take
revenge
for
the
harm
done
their
people
in
the
olden
time
There
was
nothing
for
it
then
but
that
Egede
must
go
to
them
and
this
he
did
They
seized
their
spears
when
they
saw
him
coming
but
he
made
signs
that
he
was
their
friend
When
he
had
nothing
else
to
give
them
he
let
them
cut
the
buttons
from
his
coat
Throughout
the
fifteen
years
he
spent
in
Greenland
Egede
never
wore
furs
as
did
the
natives
The
black
robe
he
thought
more
seemly
for
a
clergyman
to
his
great
discomfort
He
tells
in
his
diary
and
in
his
letters
that
often
when
he
returned
from
his
winter
travels
it
could
stand
alone
when
he
took
it
off
being
frozen
stiff
After
a
while
he
got
upon
neighborly
terms
with
the
Eskimos
but
if
anything
the
discomfort
was
greater
They
housed
him
at
night
in
their
huts
where
the
filth
and
the
stench
were
unendurable
They
showed
their
special
regard
by
first
licking
off
the
piece
of
seal
they
put
before
him
and
if
he
rejected
it
they
were
hurt
Their
housekeeping
of
which
he
got
an
inside
view
was
embarrassing
in
its
simplicity
The
dish-washing
was
done
by
the
dogs
licking
the
kettles
clean
Often
after
a
night
or
two
in
a
hut
that
held
half
a
dozen
families
he
was
compelled
to
change
his
clothes
to
the
skin
in
an
open
boat
or
out
on
the
snow
But
the
alternative
was
to
sleep
out
in
a
cold
that
sometimes
froze
his
pillow
to
the
bed
and
the
tea-cup
to
the
table
even
in
his
own
home
Above
all
he
must
learn
their
language
It
proved
a
difficult
task
for
the
Eskimo
tongue
was
both
very
simple
and
very
complex
In
all
the
things
pertaining
to
their
daily
life
it
was
exceedingly
complex
For
instance
to
catch
one
kind
of
fish
was
expressed
by
one
word
to
catch
another
kind
in
quite
different
terms
They
had
one
word
for
catching
a
young
seal
another
for
catching
an
old
one
When
it
came
to
matters
of
moral
and
spiritual
import
the
language
was
poor
to
desperation
Egede's
instruction
began
when
he
caught
the
word
"kine"--what
is
it
And
from
that
time
on
he
learned
every
day
but
the
pronunciation
was
as
varied
as
the
workaday
vocabulary
and
it
was
an
unending
task
It
proceeded
with
many
interruptions
from
the
Angekoks
who
tried
more
than
once
to
bewitch
him
but
finally
gave
it
up
convinced
that
he
was
a
great
medicine-man
himself
and
therefore
invulnerable
But
before
that
they
tried
to
foment
a
regular
mutiny
the
colony
being
by
that
time
well
under
way
and
Egede
had
to
arrest
and
punish
the
leaders
The
natives
naturally
clung
to
them
and
when
Egede
had
mastered
their
language
and
tried
to
make
clear
that
the
Angekoks
deceived
them
when
they
pretended
to
go
to
the
other
world
for
advice
they
demurred
"Did
you
ever
see
them
go?
he
asked
"Well
have
you
seen
this
God
of
yours
of
whom
you
speak
so
much?
was
their
reply
When
Egede
spoke
of
spiritual
gifts
they
asked
for
good
health
and
blubber
"Our
Angekoks
give
us
that.
Hell-fire
was
much
in
theological
evidence
in
those
days
but
among
the
Eskimos
it
was
a
failure
as
a
deterrent
They
listened
to
the
account
of
it
eagerly
and
liked
the
prospect
When
at
length
they
became
convinced
that
Egede
knew
more
than
their
Angekoks
they
came
to
him
with
the
request
that
he
would
abolish
winter
Very
likely
they
thought
that
one
who
had
such
knowledge
of
the
hot
place
ought
to
have
influence
enough
with
the
keeper
of
it
to
obtain
this
favor
It
was
not
an
easy
task
from
any
point
of
view
to
which
he
had
put
his
hands
As
that
first
winter
wore
away
there
were
gloomy
days
and
nights
and
they
were
not
brightened
when
with
the
return
of
the
sun
no
ship
arrived
from
Denmark
The
Dutch
traders
came
and
opened
their
eyes
wide
when
they
found
Egede
and
his
household
safe
and
even
on
friendly
terms
with
the
Eskimos
Pelesse--the
natives
called
the
missionary
that
as
the
nearest
they
could
come
to
the
Danish
_präst
(priest)--Pelesse
was
not
there
after
blubber
they
told
the
Dutchmen
but
to
teach
them
about
heaven
and
of
"Him
up
there,
who
had
made
them
and
wanted
them
home
with
Him
again
So
he
had
not
worked
altogether
in
vain
But
the
brief
summer
passed
and
still
no
relief
ship
The
crew
of
_Haabet
clamored
to
go
home
and
Egede
had
at
last
to
give
a
reluctant
promise
that
if
no
ship
came
in
two
weeks
he
would
break
up
His
wife
alone
refused
to
take
a
hand
in
packing
The
ship
was
coming
she
insisted
and
at
the
last
moment
it
did
come
A
boat
arriving
after
dark
brought
the
first
word
of
it
The
people
ashore
heard
voices
speaking
in
Danish
and
flew
to
Egede
who
had
gone
to
bed
with
the
news
The
ship
brought
good
cheer
The
Government
was
well
disposed
Trading
and
preaching
were
to
go
on
together
as
planned
Joyfully
then
they
built
a
bigger
and
a
better
house
and
called
their
colony
Godthaab
(Good
Hope)
The
work
was
now
fairly
under
way
Of
the
energy
and
the
hardships
it
entailed
even
we
in
our
day
that
have
heard
so
much
of
Arctic
exploration
can
have
but
a
faint
conception
Shut
in
on
the
coast
of
eternal
ice
and
silence,--silence
save
when
in
summer
the
Arctic
rivers
were
alive
and
crash
after
crash
announced
that
the
glaciers
coming
down
from
the
inland
mountains
were
"casting
their
calves,
the
great
icebergs
upon
the
ocean,--the
colonists
counted
the
days
from
the
one
when
that
year's
ship
was
lost
to
sight
till
the
returning
spring
brought
the
next
one
their
only
communication
with
their
far-off
home
In
summer
the
days
were
sometimes
burning
hot
but
the
nights
always
bitterly
cold
In
winter
says
Egede
hot
water
spilled
on
the
table
froze
as
it
ran
and
the
meat
they
cooked
was
often
frozen
at
the
bone
when
set
on
the
table
Summer
and
winter
Egede
was
on
his
travels
between
Sundays
sometimes
in
the
trader's
boat
more
often
the
only
white
man
with
one
or
two
Eskimo
companions
seeking
out
the
people
When
night
surprised
him
with
no
native
hut
in
sight
he
pulled
the
boat
on
some
desert
shore
and
commending
his
soul
to
God
slept
under
it
Once
he
and
his
son
found
an
empty
hut
and
slept
there
in
the
darkness
Not
until
day
came
again
did
they
know
that
they
had
made
their
bed
on
the
frozen
bodies
of
dead
men
who
had
once
been
the
occupants
of
the
house
and
had
died
they
never
knew
how
Peril
was
everywhere
Again
and
again
his
little
craft
was
wrecked
Once
the
house
blew
down
over
their
heads
in
one
of
the
dreadful
winter
storms
that
ravage
those
high
latitudes
Often
he
had
to
sit
on
the
rail
of
his
boat
and
let
his
numbed
feet
hang
into
the
sea
to
restore
feeling
in
them
On
land
he
sometimes
waded
waist-deep
in
snow
climbed
mountains
and
slid
down
into
valleys
having
but
the
haziest
notion
of
where
he
would
land
At
home
his
brave
wife
sat
alone
praying
for
his
safety
and
listening
to
every
sound
that
might
herald
his
return
Tremble
and
doubt
they
did
Egede
owns
but
they
never
flinched
Their
work
was
before
them
and
neither
thought
of
turning
back
The
Eskimos
soon
came
to
know
that
Egede
was
their
friend
When
his
boat
entered
a
fjord
where
they
were
fishing
and
his
rowers
shouted
out
that
the
good
priest
had
come
who
had
news
of
God
they
dropped
their
work
and
flocked
out
to
meet
him
Then
he
spoke
to
a
floating
congregation
simply
as
if
they
were
children
and
as
with
Him
whose
message
he
bore
"the
people
heard
him
gladly.
They
took
him
to
their
sick
and
asked
him
to
breathe
upon
them
which
he
did
to
humor
them
until
he
found
out
that
it
was
an
Angekok
practice
whereupon
he
refused
Once
after
he
had
spoken
of
the
raising
of
Lazarus
from
the
dead
they
took
him
to
a
new-made
grave
and
asked
him
too
to
bring
back
their
dead
They
brought
him
a
blind
man
to
be
healed
Egede
looked
upon
them
in
sorrowful
pity
"I
can
do
nothing,
he
said
"but
if
he
believes
in
Jesus
He
has
the
power
and
can
do
it.
"I
do
believe,
shouted
the
blind
man
"let
Him
heal
me.
It
occurred
to
Egede
perhaps
as
a
mere
effort
at
cleanliness
to
wash
his
eyes
in
cognac
and
he
sent
him
away
with
words
of
comfort
He
did
not
see
his
patient
again
for
thirteen
years
Then
he
was
in
a
crowd
of
Eskimos
who
came
to
Godthaab
The
man
saw
as
well
as
Egede
"Do
you
remember?
he
said
"you
washed
my
eyes
with
sharp
water
and
the
Son
of
God
in
whom
I
believed
He
made
me
to
see.
Children
the
Eskimos
were
in
their
idolatry
and
children
they
remained
as
Christians
By
Egede's
prayers
they
set
great
store
"You
ask
for
us,
they
told
him
"God
does
not
hear
us
He
does
not
understand
Eskimo.
Of
God
they
spoke
as
"Him
up
there.
They
believed
that
the
souls
of
the
dead
went
up
on
the
rainbow
and
reaching
the
moon
that
night
rested
there
in
the
moon's
house
on
a
bench
covered
with
the
white
skins
of
young
polar
bears
There
they
danced
and
played
games
and
the
northern
lights
were
the
young
people
playing
ball
Afterward
they
lived
in
houses
on
the
shore
of
a
big
lake
overshadowed
by
a
snow
mountain
When
the
waters
ran
over
the
edge
of
the
lake
it
rained
on
earth
When
the
"moon
was
dark,
it
was
down
on
earth
catching
seal
for
a
living
Thunder
was
caused
by
two
old
women
shaking
a
dried
sealskin
between
them
the
lightning
came
when
they
turned
the
white
side
out
The
"Big
Nail
we
have
heard
of
as
the
Eskimos
Pole
was
a
high-pointed
mountain
in
the
Farthest
North
on
which
the
sky
rested
and
turned
around
with
the
sun
moon
and
stars
Up
there
the
stars
were
much
bigger
Orion's
Belt
was
so
near
that
you
had
to
carry
a
whip
to
drive
him
away
The
women
were
slaves
An
Eskimo
might
have
as
many
wives
as
he
saw
fit
they
were
his
and
it
was
nobody's
business
But
adultery
was
unknown
The
seventh
commandment
in
Egede's
translation
came
to
read
"One
wife
alone
you
shall
have
and
love.
The
birth
of
a
girl
was
greeted
with
wailing
When
grown
she
was
often
wooed
by
violence
If
she
fled
from
her
admirer
he
cut
her
feet
when
he
overtook
her
so
that
she
could
run
no
more
The
old
women
were
denounced
as
witches
who
drove
the
seals
away
and
were
murdered
An
Eskimo
who
was
going
on
a
reindeer
hunt
and
found
his
aged
mother
a
burden
took
her
away
and
laid
her
in
an
open
grave
Returning
on
the
third
day
he
heard
her
groaning
yet
and
smothered
her
with
a
big
stone
He
tried
to
justify
himself
to
Egede
by
saying
that
"she
died
hard
and
it
was
a
pity
not
to
speed
her.
Yet
they
buried
a
dog's
head
with
a
child
so
that
the
dog
being
clever
could
run
ahead
and
guide
the
little
one's
steps
to
heaven
They
could
count
no
further
than
five
at
a
stretch
they
might
get
to
twenty
on
their
fingers
and
toes
but
there
they
stopped
However
they
were
not
without
resources
It
was
the
day
of
long
Sunday
services
and
the
Eskimos
were
a
restless
people
When
the
sermon
dragged
they
would
go
up
to
Egede
and
make
him
measure
on
their
arms
how
much
longer
the
talk
was
going
to
be
Then
they
tramped
back
to
their
seats
and
sat
listening
with
great
attention
all
the
time
moving
one
hand
down
the
arm
checking
off
the
preacher's
progress
If
they
got
to
the
finger-tips
before
he
stopped
they
would
shake
their
heads
sourly
and
go
back
for
a
remeasurement
No
wonder
Egede
put
his
chief
hope
in
the
children
whom
he
gathered
about
him
in
flocks
For
all
that
the
natives
loved
him
There
came
a
day
that
brought
this
message
from
the
North
"Say
to
the
speaker
to
come
to
us
to
live
for
the
other
strangers
who
come
here
can
only
talk
to
us
of
blubber
blubber
blubber
and
we
also
would
hear
of
the
great
Creator.
Egede
went
as
far
as
he
could
but
was
compelled
by
ice
and
storms
to
turn
back
after
weeks
of
incredible
hardships
The
disappointment
was
the
more
severe
to
him
because
he
had
never
quite
given
up
his
hope
of
finding
remnants
of
the
ancient
Norse
settlements
The
fact
that
the
old
records
spoke
of
a
West
Bygd
(settlement
and
an
East
Bygd
had
misled
many
into
believing
that
the
desolate
east
coast
had
once
been
colonized
Not
until
our
own
day
was
this
shown
to
be
an
error
when
Danish
explorers
searched
that
coast
for
a
hundred
miles
and
found
no
other
trace
of
civilization
than
a
beer
bottle
left
behind
by
the
explorer
Nordenskjold
Egede's
hope
had
been
that
Greenland
might
be
once
more
colonized
by
Christian
people
When
the
Danish
Government
after
some
years
sent
up
a
handful
of
soldiers
with
a
major
who
took
the
title
of
governor
to
give
the
settlement
official
character
as
a
trading
station
they
sent
with
them
twenty
unofficial
"Christians,
ten
men
out
of
the
penitentiary
and
as
many
lewd
and
drunken
women
from
the
treadmill
who
were
married
by
lot
before
setting
sail
to
give
the
thing
a
halfway
decent
look
They
were
good
enough
for
the
Eskimos
they
seem
to
have
thought
at
Copenhagen
There
followed
a
terrible
winter
during
which
mutiny
and
murder
were
threatened
"It
is
a
pity,
writes
the
missionary
"that
while
we
sleep
secure
among
the
heathen
savages
with
so-called
Christian
people
our
lives
are
not
safe.
As
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
not
for
the
soldiers
joined
in
the
mutiny
against
Egede
as
the
cause
of
their
having
to
live
in
such
a
place
and
had
not
sickness
and
death
smitten
the
malcontents
neither
he
nor
the
governor
would
have
come
safe
through
the
winter
On
the
Eskimos
this
view
of
the
supposed
fruits
of
Christian
teaching
made
its
own
impression
After
seeing
a
woman
scourged
on
shipboard
for
misbehavior
they
came
innocently
enough
to
Egede
and
suggested
that
some
of
their
best
Angekoks
be
sent
down
to
Denmark
to
teach
the
people
to
be
sober
and
decent
There
came
a
breathing
spell
after
ten
years
of
labor
in
what
had
often
enough
seemed
to
him
the
spiritual
as
well
as
physical
ice-barrens
of
the
North
when
Egede
surveyed
a
prosperous
mission
with
trade
established
a
hundred
and
fifty
children
christened
and
schooled
and
many
of
their
elders
asking
to
be
baptized
In
the
midst
of
his
rejoicing
the
summer's
ship
brought
word
from
Denmark
that
the
King
was
dead
and
orders
from
his
successor
to
abandon
the
station
Egede
might
stay
with
provisions
for
one
year
if
there
was
enough
left
over
after
fitting
out
the
ship
but
after
that
he
would
receive
no
further
help
When
the
Eskimos
heard
the
news
they
brought
their
little
children
to
the
mission
"These
will
not
let
you
go,
they
said
and
he
stayed
His
wife
whom
hardship
and
privation
and
the
lonely
waiting
for
her
husband
in
the
long
winter
nights
had
at
last
broken
down
refused
to
leave
him
though
she
sadly
needed
the
care
of
a
physician
A
few
of
the
sailors
were
persuaded
to
stay
another
year
"So
now,
Egede
wrote
in
his
diary
when
on
July
31
1731
he
had
seen
the
ship
sail
away
with
all
his
hopes
"I
am
left
alone
with
my
wife
and
three
children
ten
sailors
and
eight
Eskimos
girls
and
boys
who
have
been
with
us
from
the
start
God
let
me
live
to
see
the
blessed
day
that
brings
good
news
once
more
from
home.
His
prayer
was
heard
The
next
summer
brought
word
that
the
mission
was
to
be
continued
partly
because
Egede
had
strained
every
nerve
to
send
home
much
blubber
and
many
skins
But
it
was
as
a
glimpse
of
the
sun
from
behind
dark
clouds
His
greatest
trials
trod
hard
upon
the
good
news
To
rouse
interest
in
the
mission
Egede
had
sent
home
young
Eskimos
from
time
to
time
Three
of
these
died
of
smallpox
in
Denmark
The
fourth
came
home
and
brought
the
contagion
all
unknown
to
his
people
It
was
the
summer
fishing
season
when
the
natives
travel
much
and
far
and
wherever
he
went
they
flocked
about
him
to
hear
of
the
"Great
Lord's
land,
where
the
houses
were
so
tall
that
one
could
not
shoot
an
arrow
over
them
and
to
ask
a
multitude
of
questions
Was
the
King
very
big
Had
he
caught
many
whales
Was
he
strong
and
a
great
Angekok
and
much
more
of
the
same
kind
In
a
week
the
disease
broke
out
among
the
children
at
the
mission
and
soon
word
came
from
islands
and
fjords
where
the
Eskimos
were
fishing
of
death
and
misery
unspeakable
It
was
virgin
soil
for
the
plague
and
it
was
terribly
virulent
striking
down
young
and
old
in
every
tent
and
hut
More
than
two
thousand
natives
one-fourth
of
the
whole
population
died
that
summer
Of
two
hundred
families
near
the
mission
only
thirty
were
left
alive
A
cry
of
terror
and
anguish
rose
throughout
the
settlements
No
one
knew
what
to
do
In
vain
did
Egede
implore
them
to
keep
their
sick
apart
In
fever
delirium
they
ran
out
in
the
ice-fields
or
threw
themselves
into
the
sea
A
wild
panic
seized
the
survivors
and
they
fled
to
the
farthest
tribes
carrying
the
seeds
of
death
with
them
wherever
they
went
Whole
villages
perished
and
their
dead
lay
unburied
Utter
desolation
settled
like
a
pall
over
the
unhappy
land
Through
it
all
a
single
ray
of
hope
shone
The
faith
that
Egede
had
preached
all
those
years
and
the
life
he
had
lived
with
them
bore
their
fruit
They
had
struck
deeper
than
he
thought
They
crowded
to
him
all
that
could
as
their
one
friend
Dying
mothers
held
their
suckling
babes
up
to
him
and
died
content
In
a
deserted
island
camp
a
half-grown
girl
was
found
alone
with
three
little
children
Their
father
was
dead
When
he
knew
that
for
him
and
the
baby
there
was
no
help
he
went
to
a
cave
and
covering
himself
and
the
child
with
skins
lay
down
to
die
His
parting
words
to
his
daughter
were
"Before
you
have
eaten
the
two
seals
and
the
fish
I
have
laid
away
for
you
Pelesse
will
come
no
doubt
and
take
you
home
For
he
loves
you
and
will
take
care
of
you.
At
the
mission
every
nook
and
cranny
was
filled
with
the
sick
and
the
dying
Egede
and
his
wife
nursed
them
day
and
night
Childlike
when
death
approached
they
tried
to
put
on
their
best
clothes
or
even
to
have
new
ones
made
that
they
might
please
God
by
coming
into
His
presence
looking
fine
When
Egede
had
closed
their
eyes
he
carried
the
dead
in
his
arms
to
the
vestibule
where
in
the
morning
the
men
who
dug
the
graves
found
them
At
the
sight
of
his
suffering
the
scoffers
were
dumb
What
his
preaching
had
not
done
to
win
them
over
his
sorrows
did
They
were
at
last
one
That
dreadful
year
left
Egede
a
broken
man
In
his
dark
moments
he
reproached
himself
with
having
brought
only
misery
to
those
he
had
come
to
help
and
serve
One
thorn
which
one
would
think
he
might
have
been
spared
rankled
deep
in
it
all
Some
missionaries
of
a
dissenting
sect--Egede
was
Lutheran--had
come
with
the
smallpox
ship
to
set
up
an
establishment
of
their
own
At
their
head
was
a
man
full
of
misdirected
zeal
and
quite
devoid
of
common-sense
who
engaged
Egede
in
a
wordy
dispute
about
justification
by
faith
and
condemned
him
and
his
work
unsparingly
He
had
grave
doubts
whether
he
was
in
truth
a
"converted
man.
It
came
to
an
end
when
they
themselves
fell
ill
and
Egede
and
his
wife
had
the
last
word
after
their
own
fashion
They
nursed
the
warlike
brethren
through
their
illness
with
loving
ministrations
and
gave
them
back
to
life
let
us
hope
wiser
and
better
men
At
Christmas
1735
Egede's
faithful
wife
Gertrude
closed
her
eyes
She
had
gone
out
with
him
from
home
and
kin
to
a
hard
and
heathen
land
and
she
had
been
his
loyal
helpmeet
in
all
his
trials
Now
it
was
all
over
That
winter
scurvy
laid
him
upon
a
bed
of
pain
and
lying
there
his
heart
turned
to
the
old
home
His
son
had
come
from
Copenhagen
to
help
happily
yet
while
his
mother
lived
To
him
he
would
give
over
the
work
In
Denmark
he
could
do
more
for
it
than
in
Greenland
now
he
was
alone
On
July
29
1736
he
preached
for
the
last
time
to
his
people
and
baptized
a
little
Eskimo
to
whom
they
gave
his
name
Hans
The
following
week
he
sailed
for
home
carrying
as
all
his
earthly
wealth
his
beloved
dead
and
his
motherless
children
The
Eskimos
gathered
on
the
shore
and
wept
as
the
ship
bore
their
friend
away
They
never
saw
him
again
He
lived
in
Denmark
eighteen
years
training
young
men
to
teach
the
Eskimos
They
gave
him
the
title
of
bishop
but
so
little
to
live
on
that
he
was
forced
in
his
last
days
to
move
from
Copenhagen
to
a
country
town
to
make
both
ends
meet
His
grave
was
forgotten
by
the
generation
that
came
after
him
No
one
knows
now
where
it
is
but
in
ice-girt
Greenland
where
the
northern
lights
on
wintry
nights
flash
to
the
natives
their
message
from
the
souls
that
have
gone
home
his
memory
will
live
when
that
of
the
North
Pole
seeker
whom
the
world
applauds
is
long
forgotten
Hans
Egede
was
their
great
man
their
hero
He
was
more,--he
was
their
friend
GUSTAV
VASA
THE
FATHER
OF
SWEDEN
A
great
and
wise
woman
had
after
ages
of
war
and
bloodshed
united
the
crowns
of
the
three
Scandinavian
kingdoms
upon
one
head
In
the
strong
city
of
Kalmar
around
which
the
tide
of
battle
had
ever
raged
hottest
the
union
was
declared
in
the
closing
days
of
the
Thirteenth
Century
Norwegian
Swede
and
Dane
were
thenceforth
to
stand
together
to
the
end
of
time
so
they
resolved
It
was
all
a
vain
dream
Queen
Margaret
was
not
cold
in
her
grave
before
the
kingdoms
fell
apart
Norway
clung
to
Denmark
but
Sweden
went
her
own
way
In
the
wars
of
two
generations
the
Danish
kings
won
back
the
Swedish
crown
and
lost
it
again
and
again
until
in
152
King
Christian
II
clutched
it
for
the
last
time
at
the
head
of
a
conquering
army
He
celebrated
his
victory
with
a
general
amnesty
and
bade
the
Swedish
nobles
to
a
great
feast
held
at
the
capital
in
November
Christian
is
one
of
the
unsolved
riddles
of
history
Ablest
but
unhappiest
of
all
his
house
he
was
an
instinctive
democrat
sincerely
solicitous
for
the
welfare
of
the
plain
people
but
incredibly
cruel
and
faithless
when
the
dark
mood
seized
him
The
coronation
feast
ended
with
the
wholesale
butchery
of
the
unsuspecting
nobles
Hundreds
were
beheaded
in
the
public
square
for
days
it
was
filled
with
the
slain
It
is
small
comfort
that
the
wicked
priest
who
egged
the
King
on
to
the
dreadful
deed
was
himself
burned
at
the
stake
by
the
master
he
had
betrayed
The
Stockholm
Massacre
drowned
the
Kalmar
Union
in
its
torrents
of
blood
Retribution
came
swiftly
Above
the
peal
of
the
Christmas
bells
rose
the
clash
and
clangor
of
armed
hosts
pouring
forth
from
the
mountain
fastnesses
to
avenge
the
foul
treachery
They
were
led
by
Gustav[1
Eriksson
Vasa
a
young
noble
upon
whose
head
Christian
had
set
a
price
[Footnote
1
The
older
spelling
of
this
name
is
followed
here
in
preference
to
the
more
modern
Gustaf
Gustav
Vasa
himself
wrote
his
name
so.
The
Vasas
were
among
the
oldest
and
best
of
the
great
Swedish
families
It
was
said
of
them
that
they
ever
loved
a
friend
hated
a
foe
and
never
forgot
Gustav
was
born
in
the
castle
of
Lindholmen
when
the
news
that
the
world
had
grown
suddenly
big
by
the
discovery
of
lands
beyond
the
unknown
seas
was
still
ringing
through
Europe
on
May
12
1496
He
was
brought
up
in
the
home
of
his
kinsman
the
Swedish
patriot
Sten
Sture
and
early
showed
the
fruits
of
his
training
"See
what
I
will
do,
he
boasted
in
school
when
he
was
thirteen
"I
will
go
to
Dalecarlia
rouse
the
people
and
give
the
Jutes
(Danes
a
black
eye.
Master
Ivar
his
Danish
teacher
gave
him
a
whaling
for
that
White
with
anger
the
boy
drove
his
dirk
through
the
book
nailing
it
to
the
desk
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
Master
Ivar's
eyes
followed
the
slim
figure
in
the
scarlet
cloak
and
he
sighed
wearily
"_nobilium
nati
nolunt
aliquid
pati_,--the
children
of
the
great
will
put
up
with
nothing.
Hardly
yet
of
age
he
served
under
the
banner
of
Sten
Sture
against
King
Christian
and
was
one
of
six
hostages
sent
to
the
King
when
he
asked
an
interview
of
the
Swedish
leader
But
Christian
stayed
away
from
the
meeting
and
carried
the
hostages
off
to
Denmark
against
his
plighted
faith
There
Gustav
was
held
prisoner
a
year
All
that
winter
rumors
of
great
armaments
against
Sweden
filled
the
land
He
heard
the
young
bloods
from
the
court
prate
about
bending
the
stiff
necks
in
the
country
across
the
Sound
and
watched
them
throw
dice
for
Swedish
castles
and
Swedish
women,--part
of
the
loot
when
his
fatherland
should
be
laid
under
the
yoke
Ready
to
burst
with
anger
and
grief
he
sat
silent
at
their
boasts
In
the
spring
he
escaped
disguised
as
a
cattle-herder
and
made
his
way
to
Lübeck
where
he
found
refuge
in
the
house
of
the
wealthy
merchant
Kort
König
They
soon
heard
in
Denmark
where
he
was
and
the
King
sent
letters
demanding
his
surrender
but
the
burghers
of
the
Hanse
town
hated
Christian
with
cause
and
would
not
give
him
up
Then
came
Gustav's
warder
who
had
gone
bail
for
him
in
sixteen
hundred
gulden
and
pleaded
for
his
prisoner
"I
am
not
a
prisoner,
was
Gustav's
retort
"I
am
a
hostage
for
whom
the
Danish
king
pledged
his
oath
and
faith
If
any
one
can
prove
that
I
was
taken
captive
in
a
fight
or
for
just
cause
let
him
stand
forth
Ambushed
was
I
and
betrayed.
The
Lübeck
men
thought
of
the
plots
King
Christian
was
forever
hatching
against
them
Now
if
he
succeeded
in
getting
Sweden
under
his
heel
their
turn
would
come
next
Better
they
said
send
this
Gustav
home
to
his
own
country
perchance
he
might
keep
the
King
busy
there
by
which
they
showed
their
good
sense
His
ex-keeper
was
packed
off
back
home
and
Gustav
reached
Sweden
sole
passenger
on
a
little
coast-trader
on
May
31
1520
A
stone
marks
the
spot
where
he
landed
near
Kalmar
for
then
struck
the
hour
of
Sweden's
freedom
But
not
yet
for
many
weary
months
did
the
people
hear
its
summons
Swedish
manhood
was
at
its
lowest
ebb
Stockholm
was
held
by
the
widow
of
Sten
Sture
with
a
half-famished
garrison
In
Kalmar
another
woman
Anna
Bjelke
commanded
but
her
men
murmured
and
the
fall
of
the
fortress
was
imminent
When
Gustav
Vasa
who
had
slipped
in
unseen
exhorted
them
to
stand
fast
they
would
have
mobbed
him
He
left
as
he
had
come
the
day
before
the
surrender
Travelling
by
night
he
made
his
way
inland
finding
everywhere
fear
and
distrust
The
King
had
promised
that
if
they
would
obey
him
"they
should
never
want
for
herring
and
salt,
so
they
told
Gustav
and
when
he
tried
to
put
heart
into
them
and
rouse
their
patriotism
they
took
up
bows
and
arrows
and
bade
him
be
gone
Indeed
there
were
not
wanting
those
who
shot
at
him
Like
a
hunted
deer
he
fled
from
hamlet
to
hamlet
Such
friends
as
he
had
left
advised
him
to
throw
himself
upon
the
King's
mercy
told
him
of
the
amnesty
proclaimed
But
Gustav's
thoughts
dwelt
grimly
among
the
Northern
mountaineers
whom
as
a
boy
he
had
bragged
he
would
set
against
the
tyrant
Insensibly
he
shaped
his
course
toward
their
country
He
was
with
his
brother-in-law
Joachim
Brahe
when
the
King's
message
bidding
him
to
the
coronation
came
Gustav
begged
him
not
to
go
but
Brahe's
wife
and
children
were
within
Christian's
reach
and
he
did
not
dare
stay
away
When
he
left
the
fugitive
hid
in
his
ancestral
home
at
Räfsnäs
on
lake
Mälar
There
one
of
Brahe's
men
brought
him
news
of
the
massacre
in
which
his
master
and
Gustav's
father
had
perished
His
mother
grandmother
and
sisters
were
dragged
away
to
perish
in
Danish
dungeons
On
Gustav's
head
the
King
had
set
a
price
and
spies
were
even
then
on
his
track
Gustav's
mind
was
made
up
What
was
there
now
to
wait
for
Clad
as
a
peasant
he
started
for
Dalecarlia
with
a
single
servant
to
keep
him
company
but
before
he
reached
the
mines
the
man
stole
all
his
money
and
ran
away
He
had
to
work
now
to
live
and
hired
out
to
Anders
Persson
the
farmer
of
Rankhyttan
He
had
not
been
there
many
days
when
one
of
the
women
saw
an
embroidered
sleeve
stick
out
under
his
coat
and
told
her
master
that
the
new
hand
was
not
what
he
pretended
to
be
The
farmer
called
him
aside
and
Gustav
told
him
frankly
who
he
was
Anders
Persson
kept
his
secret
but
advised
him
not
to
stay
long
in
any
one
place
lest
his
enemies
get
wind
of
him
He
slipped
away
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
nearly
lost
his
life
by
breaking
through
the
ice
but
reached
Ornäs
on
the
other
side
of
Lake
Runn
half
dead
with
cold
and
exposure
He
knew
that
another
Persson
who
had
been
with
him
in
the
war
lived
there
and
found
his
house
Arendt
Persson
was
a
rascal
He
received
him
kindly
but
when
he
slept
harnessed
his
horse
and
went
to
Måns
Nilsson
a
neighbor
with
the
news
the
King's
reward
would
make
them
both
rich
if
he
would
help
him
seize
the
outlawed
man
Måns
Nilsson
held
with
the
Danes
but
he
was
no
traitor
and
he
showed
the
fellow
the
door
He
went
next
to
the
King's
sheriff
he
would
be
bound
to
help
To
be
sure
he
would
claim
the
lion's
share
of
the
blood-money
but
something
was
better
than
nothing
The
sheriff
came
soon
enough
with
a
score
of
armed
men
But
Arendt
Persson
had
not
reckoned
with
his
honest
wife
She
guessed
his
errand
and
let
Gustav
down
from
the
window
to
the
rear
gate
where
she
had
a
sleigh
and
team
in
waiting
When
the
sheriff's
posse
surrounded
the
house
Gustav
was
well
on
his
way
to
Master
Jon
the
parson
of
Svärdsjö
who
was
his
friend
Tradition
has
it
that
while
Christian
was
King
the
brave
little
woman
never
dared
show
her
face
in
the
house
again
Master
Jon
was
all
right
but
news
of
the
man-hunt
had
run
through
the
country
and
when
the
parson's
housekeeper
one
day
saw
him
hold
the
wash-bowl
for
his
guest
she
wanted
to
know
why
he
was
so
polite
to
a
common
clod
Master
Jon
told
her
that
it
was
none
of
her
business
but
that
night
he
piloted
his
friend
across
the
lake
to
Isala
where
Sven
Elfsson
lived
a
gamekeeper
who
knew
the
country
and
could
be
trusted
The
good
parson
was
hardly
out
of
sight
on
his
way
back
when
the
sheriff's
men
came
looking
for
Gustav
It
did
not
occur
to
them
that
the
yokel
who
stood
warming
himself
by
the
stove
might
be
the
man
they
were
after
But
the
gamekeeper's
wife
was
quick
to
see
his
peril
She
was
baking
bread
and
had
just
put
the
loaves
into
the
oven
with
a
long-handled
spade
"Here
you
lummox!
she
cried
and
whacked
him
soundly
over
the
back
with
it
"what
are
ye
standing
there
gaping
at
Did
ye
never
see
folks
afore
Get
back
to
your
work
in
the
barn.
And
Gustav
taking
the
hint
slunk
out
of
the
room
For
three
days
after
that
he
lay
hidden
under
a
fallen
tree
in
the
snow
and
bitter
cold
but
even
there
he
was
not
safe
and
the
gamekeeper
took
him
deeper
into
the
forest
where
a
big
spruce
grew
on
a
hill
in
the
middle
of
a
frozen
swamp
There
no
one
would
seek
him
till
he
could
make
a
shift
to
get
him
out
of
the
country
The
hill
is
still
there
the
people
call
it
the
King's
Hill
and
not
after
King
Christian
either
But
in
those
long
nights
when
Gustav
Vasa
listened
to
the
hungry
wolves
howling
in
the
woods
and
nosing
about
his
retreat
it
was
hardly
kingly
conceits
his
mind
brooded
over
His
father
and
kinsmen
were
murdered
his
mother
and
sister
in
the
pitiless
grasp
of
the
tyrant
who
was
hunting
him
to
his
death
he
the
last
of
his
race
alone
and
forsaken
by
his
own
Bitter
sorrow
filled
his
soul
at
the
plight
of
his
country
that
had
fallen
so
low
But
the
hope
of
the
young
years
came
to
the
rescue
all
was
not
lost
yet
And
in
the
morning
came
Sven
the
gamekeeper
with
a
load
of
straw
at
the
bottom
of
which
he
hid
him
So
no
one
would
be
the
wiser
It
was
well
he
did
it
for
half-way
to
the
next
town
some
prowling
soldiers
overtook
them
and
just
to
make
sure
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
straw
prodded
the
load
with
their
spears
Nothing
stirred
and
they
went
on
their
way
But
a
spear
had
gashed
Gustav's
leg
and
presently
blood
began
to
drip
in
the
snow
Sven
had
his
wits
about
him
He
got
down
and
cut
the
fetlock
of
one
of
the
beasts
with
his
jack-knife
so
that
it
bled
and
no
one
need
ask
questions
When
they
got
to
Marnäs
Gustav
was
weak
from
the
loss
of
blood
but
a
friendly
surgeon
was
found
to
bind
up
his
wounds
Farther
and
farther
north
he
fled
keeping
to
the
deep
woods
in
the
day
until
he
reached
Rättwik
Feeling
safer
there
he
spoke
to
the
people
coming
from
church
one
Sunday
and
implored
them
to
shake
off
the
Danish
yoke
But
they
only
shook
their
heads
He
was
a
stranger
among
them
and
they
would
talk
it
over
with
their
neighbors
Not
yet
were
his
wanderings
over
To
Mora
he
went
next
where
Parson
Jakob
hid
him
in
a
lonely
farm-house
Evil
chance
led
the
spies
direct
to
his
hiding-place
and
once
more
it
was
the
housewife
whose
quick
wit
saved
him
Dame
Margit
was
brewing
the
Yule
beer
when
she
saw
them
coming
In
a
trice
she
had
Gustav
in
the
cellar
and
rolled
the
brewing
vat
over
the
trap-door
Then
they
might
search
as
they
saw
fit
there
was
nothing
there
The
first
blood
was
spilled
for
Gustav
Vasa
while
he
was
at
Mora
and
it
was
a
Dane
who
did
it
He
was
the
kind
that
liked
to
see
fair
play
when
an
under-sheriff
came
looking
for
the
hunted
man
there
the
Dane
waylaid
and
killed
him
Christmas
morning
when
Master
Jakob
had
preached
his
sermon
in
the
church
Gustav
spoke
to
the
congregation
out
in
the
snow-covered
churchyard
A
gravestone
was
his
pulpit
Eloquent
always
his
sorrows
and
wrongs
and
the
memory
of
the
hard
months
lent
wings
to
his
words
His
speech
lives
yet
in
Dalecarlia
for
now
he
was
among
its
mountains
"It
is
good
to
see
this
great
meeting,
he
said
"but
when
I
think
of
our
fatherland
I
am
filled
with
grief
At
what
peril
I
am
here
with
you
you
know
who
see
me
hounded
as
a
wild
beast
day
by
day
hour
by
hour
But
our
beloved
country
is
more
to
me
than
life
How
long
must
we
be
thralls
we
who
were
born
to
freedom
Those
of
you
who
are
old
remember
what
persecution
Swedish
men
and
women
have
suffered
from
the
Danish
kings
The
young
have
heard
the
story
of
it
and
have
learned
from
they
were
little
children
to
hate
and
resist
such
rule
These
tyrants
have
laid
waste
our
land
and
sucked
its
marrow
until
nothing
remains
for
us
but
empty
houses
and
lean
fields
Our
very
lives
are
not
safe.
He
called
upon
them
to
rise
and
drive
the
invaders
out
If
they
wanted
a
leader
he
was
ready
His
words
stirred
the
mountaineers
deeply
Cries
of
anger
were
heard
in
the
crowd
it
was
not
the
first
time
they
had
taken
up
arms
in
the
cause
of
freedom
But
when
they
talked
it
over
the
older
heads
prevailed
there
had
not
been
time
enough
to
hear
both
sides
They
told
him
that
they
would
not
desert
the
King
he
must
expect
nothing
of
them
Broken-hearted
and
desperate
Gustav
Vasa
turned
toward
the
Norwegian
frontier
He
would
leave
the
country
for
which
there
was
no
hope
While
the
table
in
the
poorest
home
groaned
with
Yuletide
cheer
Sweden's
coming
king
hid
under
an
old
bridge
outcast
and
starving
till
it
was
safe
to
leave
Then
he
took
up
his
weary
journey
alone
The
winter
cold
had
grown
harder
as
the
days
grew
shorter
Famished
wolves
dogged
his
steps
but
he
outran
them
on
his
snow-shoes
By
night
he
slept
in
some
wayside
shelter
such
as
they
build
for
travellers
in
that
desolate
country
or
in
the
brush
The
snow
grew
deeper
and
the
landscape
wilder
as
he
went
For
days
he
had
gone
without
food
when
he
saw
the
sun
set
behind
the
lofty
range
that
was
to
bar
him
out
of
home
and
hope
forever
Even
there
was
no
abiding
place
for
him
What
thoughts
of
his
vanished
dream
perchance
of
the
distant
lands
across
the
seas
where
the
tyrant's
hand
could
not
reach
him
were
in
his
mind
who
knows
as
he
bent
his
strength
to
the
last
and
hardest
stage
of
his
journey
He
was
almost
there
when
he
heard
shouts
behind
him
and
turned
to
sell
his
life
dear
Two
men
on
skis
were
calling
to
him
They
were
unarmed
and
he
waited
to
let
them
come
up
Their
story
was
soon
told
They
had
come
to
call
him
back
After
he
left
an
old
soldier
whom
they
knew
in
Mora
had
come
from
the
south
and
told
them
worse
things
than
even
Gustav
knew
It
was
all
true
about
the
Stockholm
murder
worse
the
King
was
having
gallows
set
up
in
every
county
to
hang
all
those
on
who
said
him
nay
a
heavy
tax
was
laid
upon
the
peasants
and
whoever
did
not
pay
was
to
have
a
hand
or
foot
cut
off
they
could
still
follow
the
plow
And
now
they
had
sent
away
the
one
man
who
could
lead
against
the
Danes
with
the
forests
full
of
outlawed
men
who
would
have
enlisted
under
him
as
soon
as
ever
the
cry
was
raised
While
the
men
of
Dalecarlia
were
debating
the
news
among
themselves
orders
came
from
the
bailiff
at
Westerås
that
the
tax
was
to
be
paid
forthwith
That
night
runners
were
sent
on
the
trail
of
Gustav
to
tell
him
to
come
back
they
were
ready
When
he
came
it
was
as
if
a
mighty
storm
swept
through
the
mountains
The
people
rose
in
a
body
Every
day
whole
parishes
threw
off
their
allegiance
to
King
Christian
Sunday
after
Sunday
Gustav
spoke
to
the
people
at
their
meeting-houses
and
they
raised
their
spears
and
swore
to
follow
him
to
death
Two
months
after
the
murder
in
Stockholm
an
army
of
thousands
that
swelled
like
an
avalanche
was
marching
south
and
province
after
province
joined
in
the
rebellion
King
Christian's
host
met
them
at
Brunbäck
in
April
One
of
its
leaders
asked
the
country
folk
what
kind
of
men
the
Dalecarlians
were
and
when
he
was
told
that
they
drank
water
and
ate
bread
made
of
bark
he
cried
out
"Such
a
people
the
devil
himself
couldn't
whip
let
us
get
out.
But
his
advice
was
not
taken
and
the
Danish
army
was
wiped
out
Gustav
halted
long
enough
to
drill
his
men
and
give
them
time
to
temper
their
arrows
and
spears
then
he
fell
upon
Westerås
and
beat
the
Danes
there
The
peasant
mob
scattered
too
soon
to
loot
the
town
and
the
King's
men
came
back
with
a
sudden
rush
Only
Gustav's
valor
and
presence
of
mind
saved
the
day
that
had
been
won
once
from
being
lost
again
When
it
was
seen
that
the
Danes
were
not
invincible
the
whole
country
rose
took
the
scattered
castles
and
put
their
defenders
to
the
sword
Gustav
bore
the
rising
on
his
shoulders
from
first
to
last
He
was
everywhere
ordering
and
leading
His
fiery
eloquence
won
over
the
timorous
his
irresistible
advance
swept
every
obstacle
aside
In
May
he
took
Upsala
by
midsummer
he
was
besieging
Stockholm
itself
Most
of
the
other
cities
were
in
his
hands
The
Hanse
towns
had
found
out
what
this
Gustav
could
do
at
home
They
sang
his
praise
but
as
for
backing
him
with
their
purse
that
was
another
matter
They
refused
to
lend
Gustav
two
siege-guns
when
he
lay
before
Stockholm
though
he
offered
to
pledge
a
castle
for
each
He
had
no
money
Happily
his
enemy
Christian
was
even
worse
off
Neither
pledges
nor
promises
could
get
him
the
money
he
needed
His
chief
men
were
fighting
among
themselves
and
made
peace
only
to
turn
upon
him
Within
a
year
after
the
Swedish
people
had
chosen
Gustav
Vasa
to
be
Regent
at
the
Diet
of
Vadstena
Christian
went
into
exile
and
when
he
tried
to
get
his
kingdom
back
into
prison
where
he
languished
the
rest
of
his
life
He
fully
deserved
his
fate
Yet
he
meant
well
and
had
done
some
good
things
in
his
day
Had
he
been
able
to
rule
himself
he
might
have
ruled
others
with
better
success
Schoolboys
remember
with
gratitude
that
he
forbade
teachers
to
"spank
their
pupils
overmuch
and
without
judgment
as
was
their
wont.
At
the
Diet
of
Vadstena
the
people
had
offered
Gustav
the
crown
but
he
put
it
from
him
Scarce
eight
months
had
passed
since
he
hid
under
the
bridge
hunted
and
starving
When
Stockholm
had
fallen
after
a
siege
of
two
years
and
all
Sweden
was
free
the
people
met
(1523
and
made
him
King
whether
or
no
He
still
objected
but
gave
in
at
last
and
was
crowned
Popular
favor
is
fickle
Hard
times
came
that
were
not
made
easier
by
Gustav's
determination
to
fill
the
royal
coffers
and
the
very
Dalecarlians
who
had
put
him
in
the
high
seat
rose
against
him
and
served
notice
that
if
things
did
not
mend
they
would
have
none
of
him
Gustav
made
sure
that
they
had
no
backing
elsewhere
then
went
up
and
persuaded
them
to
be
good
by
cutting
off
the
heads
of
their
leaders
who
both
happened
to
be
priests
one
was
even
a
bishop
He
had
been
taught
in
a
school
that
always
found
an
axe
ready
to
hand
Let
those
who
lament
the
savagery
of
modern
warfare
consider
what
happened
then
to
a
Danish
fleet
that
tried
to
bring
relief
to
hard-pressed
Stockholm
It
was
beaten
in
a
fight
in
which
six
hundred
men
were
taken
prisoners
They
were
all
say
the
accounts
"tied
hand
and
foot
and
flung
overboard
amid
the
beating
of
drums
and
blowing
of
trumpets
to
drown
their
cries.
The
clergy
fared
little
better
than
the
laymen
in
that
age
but
then
it
was
their
own
fault
In
plotting
and
scrapping
they
were
abreast
of
the
worst
and
took
the
consequences
They
were
the
days
of
the
Reformation
and
Gustav
would
not
have
been
human
had
he
failed
to
see
a
way
out
of
his
money
troubles
by
confiscating
church
property
He
had
pawned
the
country's
trade
to
the
merchants
of
Lübeck
and
there
was
nothing
else
left
Naturally
the
church
opposed
him
The
King
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
He
called
a
meeting
and
told
the
people
that
he
was
sick
of
it
all
He
had
encouraged
the
Reformation
for
their
good
now
if
they
did
not
stand
by
him
they
might
choose
between
him
and
his
enemies
The
oldest
priest
arose
at
that
and
said
that
the
church's
property
was
sacred
The
King
asked
if
the
rest
of
them
thought
the
same
way
Only
one
voice
was
raised
and
to
say
yes
"Then,
said
Gustav
"I
don't
want
to
be
your
King
any
more
If
it
does
not
rain
you
blame
me
if
the
sun
does
not
shine
you
do
the
same
It
is
always
so
All
of
you
want
to
be
masters
After
all
my
trouble
and
labor
for
you
you
would
as
lief
see
my
head
split
with
an
axe
though
none
of
you
dare
lay
hold
of
the
handle
Give
me
back
what
I
have
spent
in
your
service
and
I
will
go
away
and
never
come
back.
And
go
he
did
to
his
castle
with
half
a
dozen
of
his
nearest
friends
They
sat
and
looked
at
one
another
when
he
was
gone
and
then
priests
and
nobles
fell
to
arguing
among
themselves
all
talking
at
once
The
plain
people
the
burghers
and
the
peasants
listened
awhile
but
when
they
got
no
farther
let
them
know
that
if
they
couldn't
settle
it
they
the
people
would
and
in
a
way
that
would
give
them
little
joy
The
upshot
of
it
all
was
that
messengers
were
sent
to
bring
the
King
back
He
made
them
go
three
times
and
when
he
came
at
last
it
was
as
absolute
master
In
the
ordering
of
the
kingdom
that
was
made
there
he
became
the
head
of
the
church
as
well
as
of
the
state
Gustav's
pen
was
as
sharp
as
his
tongue
When
Hans
Brask
the
oldest
prelate
in
the
land
who
had
stood
stoutly
by
the
old
régime
left
the
country
and
refused
to
come
back
he
wrote
to
him
"As
long
as
you
might
milk
and
shear
your
sheep
you
staid
by
them
When
God
spake
and
said
you
were
to
feed
them
not
to
shear
and
slaughter
them
you
ran
away
Every
honest
man
can
judge
if
you
have
done
well.
Hard
words
to
a
good
old
man
but
there
were
plenty
of
others
who
deserved
them
That
was
the
end
of
the
hierarchy
in
Sweden
But
not
of
the
unruly
peasants
who
had
tasted
the
joys
of
king-making
How
kindly
they
took
to
the
Reformation
at
the
outset
one
can
judge
from
the
demand
of
some
of
them
that
the
King
should
"burn
or
otherwise
kill
such
as
ate
meat
on
Friday.
They
rose
again
and
again
and
would
listen
only
to
the
argument
of
force
When
the
Lübeckers
pressed
hard
for
the
payment
of
old
debts
and
the
treasury
was
empty
as
usual
King
Gustav
hit
upon
a
new
kind
of
revenue
He
demanded
of
every
church
in
the
land
that
it
give
up
its
biggest
bell
to
the
funds
It
was
the
last
straw
The
Dalecarlians
rose
against
what
they
deemed
sacrilege
under
the
leadership
of
Måns
Nilsson
and
Anders
Persson
of
Rankhyttan
the
very
men
who
had
befriended
Gustav
in
his
need
and
the
insurrection
spread
The
"War
of
the
Bells
was
settled
with
the
sword
and
the
peasants
gave
in
But
Gustav
came
of
a
stock
that
"never
forgot.
Two
years
later
when
his
hands
were
free
at
home
he
suddenly
invaded
Dalecarlia
with
a
powerful
army
determined
to
"pull
those
weeds
up
by
the
roots.
He
summoned
the
peasants
to
Thing
made
a
ring
around
them
of
armed
men
and
gave
them
their
choice
"Submit
now
for
good
and
all,
he
said
"or
I
will
spoil
the
land
so
that
cock
shall
not
crow
nor
hound
bark
in
it
again
forever!
The
frightened
peasants
fell
on
their
knees
and
begged
for
mercy
He
made
them
give
up
their
leaders
including
his
former
friends
and
they
were
all
put
to
the
sword
After
that
there
was
peace
in
Dalecarlia
Gustav
Vasa's
long
reign
ended
in
1560
Like
his
enemy
Christian
II
he
was
a
strange
mixture
of
contradictions
He
was
brave
in
battle
wise
in
council
pious
if
not
a
saint
clean
and
merciful
when
mercy
fitted
into
his
plans
His
enemies
called
him
a
greedy
suspicious
despot
Greedy
he
was
More
than
eleven
thousand
farms
were
confiscated
by
the
crown
during
his
reign
and
he
left
four
thousand
farms
and
a
great
fortune
to
his
children
as
his
personal
share
But
historians
have
called
him
"the
great
housekeeper
who
found
waste
and
loss
and
left
an
ordered
household
He
gave
all
for
Sweden
and
all
he
had
was
at
her
call
It
was
share
and
share
alike
in
his
view
Despotic
he
could
be
too
_L'état
c'est
moi
might
have
been
said
by
him
But
he
did
not
exploit
the
state
he
built
it
He
fashioned
Sweden
out
of
a
bunch
of
quarrelsome
provincial
governments
into
a
hereditary
monarchy
as
the
best
way--indeed
the
only
way
then--of
giving
it
strength
and
stability
He
was
suspicious
because
everybody
had
betrayed
him
or
had
tried
to
With
all
that
his
steady
purpose
was
to
raise
and
enlighten
his
people
and
make
them
keep
the
peace
if
he
had
to
adopt
the
Irishman's
plan
of
keeping
it
himself
with
an
axe
He
was
the
father
of
a
line
of
great
warriors
Gustav
Adolf
was
his
grandson
Bent
under
the
burden
of
years
he
bade
his
people
good-by
at
the
Diet
of
Stockholm
a
few
weeks
before
his
death
His
old
eloquence
rings
unimpaired
in
the
farewell
He
thanked
God
who
had
chosen
him
as
His
tool
to
set
Sweden
free
from
thralldom
Almost
might
he
liken
himself
to
King
David
whom
God
from
a
shepherd
had
made
the
leader
of
his
people
No
such
hope
was
in
his
heart
when
forty
years
before
he
hid
in
the
woods
from
a
bloodthirsty
enemy
For
what
he
had
done
wrong
as
king
he
asked
the
people's
pardon
it
was
not
done
on
purpose
He
knew
well
that
many
thought
him
a
hard
ruler
but
the
time
would
come
when
they
would
gladly
dig
him
up
from
his
grave
if
they
only
could
And
with
that
he
went
out
bowing
deeply
to
the
Diet
the
tears
streaming
down
his
face
They
saw
him
no
more
but
on
his
tomb
the
Swedish
people
forgetting
all
else
have
written
that
he
was
the
"Father
of
his
Country.
ABSALON
WARRIOR
BISHOP
OF
THE
NORTH
A
welcome
change
awaits
the
traveller
who
having
shaken
off
the
chill
of
the
German
Dreadnaughts
at
Kiel
crosses
the
Baltic
to
the
Danish
Islands--a
change
from
the
dread
portents
of
war
to
smiling
peace
There
can
be
nothing
more
pastoral
and
restful
than
the
Seeland
landscape
as
framed
in
a
car
window
yet
he
misses
its
chief
charm
whom
its
folk-lore
escapes--the
countless
legends
that
cling
to
field
and
forest
from
days
long
gone
The
guide-book
gives
scarce
a
hint
of
them
but
turn
from
its
page
and
they
meet
you
at
every
step
hail
you
from
every
homestead
every
copse
Nor
is
their
story
always
of
peace
Here
was
Knud
Lavard
slain
by
his
envious
kinsman
for
the
crown
and
a
miraculous
spring
gushed
forth
where
he

Of
the
church
they
built
for
the
pilgrims
who
sought
it
from
afar
they
will
show
you
the

but
the
spring
dried
up
with
the
simple
old
faith
Yonder
under
the
roof
of
Ringsted
church
lie
Denmark's
greatest
dead
Not
half

from
the

at

your

labors
past
a

crowned
by
a
venerable

Holy
Anders

So
saintly
was
that
masterful
priest
that
he
was
wont
when
he
prayed
to
hang
his
hat
and
gloves
on
a
sunbeam
as
on
a
hook
And
woe
to
the
land
if
his

a
village
church
rears
twin
towers
above
the
wheat-field
where
the
skylark
soars
and
sings
to
its
nesting
mate
For
seven
hundred
years
the
story
of
that
church
and
its
builder
has
been
told
at
Danish
firesides
and
the
time
will
never
come
when
it
is
forgotten

for
Sir

He
would
have

without

But
no
such
things
troubled
him
while
he
battled
in
foreign
lands
all

It
was
autumn
when
he
returned
and
saw
from
afar
the
swell
behind
which
lay
Fjenneslev
and
home
Impatiently
he
spurred
his
horse
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
for

come
of

many

there

Absalon
and
Esbern
were
not
twins
as
tradition
has
it
They
were
better
than
that
They
became
the
great
heroes
of
their
day
and
the
years
have
not
dimmed
their
renown
And
Absalon
reached
far
beyond
the
boundaries
of
little
Denmark
to
every
people
that
speaks
the
English
tongue
For
it
was
he
who
as
archbishop
of
the
North
"strictly
and
earnestly
charged
his
friend
and
clerk
Saxo
to
gather
the
Danish
chronicles
while
yet
it
was
time
because
says
Saxo
in
the
preface
of
his
monumental
work
"he
could
no
longer
abide
that
his
fatherland
which
he
always
honored
and
magnified
with
especial
zeal
should
be
without
a
record
of
the
great
deeds
of
the
fathers.
And
from
the
record
Saxo
wrote
we
have
our
Hamlet
It
was
when
they
had
grown
great
and
famous
that
Sir
Asker
and
his
wife
built
the
church
in
thanksgiving
for
their
boys
not
when
they
were
born
and
the
way
that
came
to
light
was
good
and
wholesome
They
were
about
to
rebuild
the
church
on
which
there
had
been
no
towers
at
all
since
they
crumbled
in
the
middle
ages
and
had
decided
to
put
on
only
one
for
the
sour
critics
who
are
never
content
in
writing
a
people's
history
unless
they
can
divest
it
of
all
its
flesh
and
make
it
sit
in
its
bones
as
it
were
sneered
at
the
tradition
and
called
it
an
old
woman's
tale
But
they
did
not
shout
quite
so
loud
when
in
peeling
off
the
whitewash
of
the
Reformation
the
mason's
hammer
brought
forth
mural
paintings
that
grew
and
grew
until
there
stood
the
whole
story
to
read
on
the
wall
with
Sir
Asker
himself
and
the
Lady
Inge
clad
in
garments
of
the
Twelfth
Century
bringing
to
the
Virgin
the
church
with
the
twin
towers
So
the
folk-lore
was
not
so
far
out
after
all
and
the
church
was
rebuilt
with
two
towers
as
it
should
be
Under
its
eaves
whether
of
straw
or
tile
the
two
boys
played
their
childish
games
and
before
long
there
came
to
join
in
them
another
of
their
own
age
young
Valdemar
whose
father
the
very
Knud
Lavard
mentioned
above
had
been
foully
murdered
a
while
before
It
was
a
time
says
Saxo
in
which
"he
must
be
of
stout
heart
and
strong
head
who
dared
aspire
to
Denmark's
crown
For
in
less
than
a
hundred
years
more
than
sixteen
of
her
kings
and
their
kin
were
either
slain
without
cause
by
their
own
subjects
or
otherwise
met
a
sudden
death.
Sir
Asker
and
the
murdered
Knud
had
been
foster
brothers
and
throughout
the
bloody
years
that
followed
he
and
his
brothers
sons
of
the
powerful
Skjalm
Hvide,[3
espoused
his
cause
in
good
and
evil
days
while
they
saw
to
it
that
no
harm
came
to
the
young
prince
under
their
roof

The
three
boys
as
they
grew
up

bred
to
the
stern
duties
of
fighting

as
was
the
custom
of
their
class
Absalon
indeed
was
destined
for
the
church
but
in
a
country
so
recently
won
from
the
old
war
gods
it
was
the
church
militant
yet
and
he
wielded
spear
and
sword
with
the
best
of
them
When
at
eighteen
they
sent
him
to
France
to
be
taught
he
did
not
for
his
theological
studies
neglect
the
instruction
of
his
boyhood
There
he
became
the
disciple
and
friend
of
the
Abbot
Bernard
of
Clairvaux
more
powerful
then
than
prince
or
Pope
and
when
the
abbot
preached
the
second
great
crusade
promising
eternal
salvation
to
those
who
took
up
arms
against
the
unbelievers
whether
to
wrest
from
them
the
Holy
Sepulchre
or
to
plant
the
cross
among
the
wild
heathen
on
the
Baltic
his
heart
burned
hot
within
him
It
was
a
long
way
to
the
Holy
Land
but
with
the
Baltic
robbers
his
people
had
a
grievous
score
to
settle
Their
yells
had
sounded
in
his
boyish
ears
as
they
ravished
the
shores
of
his
fatherland
penetrating
with
murder
and
pillage
almost
to
his
peaceful
home
And
so
while
he
lent
a
diligent
ear
to
the
teachings
of
the
church
earning
the
name
of
the
"most
learned
clerk
in
the
cloister
of
Ste
Geneviève
in
Paris
daily
he
laid
the
breviary
aside
and
took
up
sword
and
lance
learning
the
arts
of
modern
warfare
with
the
graces
of
chivalry
In
the
old
way
of
fighting
man
to
man
the
men
of
the
North
had
been
the
equals
of
any
if
not
their
betters
but
against
the
new
methods
of
warfare
their
prowess
availed
little
Absalon
the
monk
kept
his
body
strong
while
soul
and
mind
matured
When
nothing
more
adventurous
befell
he
chopped
down
trees
for
the
cloister
hearths
But
oftener
the
clash
of
arms
echoed
in
the
quiet
halls
or
the
peaceful
brethren
crossed
themselves
as
they
watched
him
break
an
unruly
horse
in
the
cloister
fen
Saxo
tells
us
that
he
swam
easily
in
full
armor
and
in
more
than
one
campaign
in
later
years
saved
drowning
comrades
who
were
not
so
well
taught
The
while
he
watched
rising
all
about
some
of
the
finest
churches
in
Christendom
It
was
the
era
of
cathedral
building
in
Europe
The
Romanesque
style
of
architecture
had
reached
its
highest
development
in
the
very
France
where
he
spent
his
young
manhood's
years
and
the
Gothic
with
its
stamp
of
massive
strength
was
beginning
to
displace
its
gentler
curve
Ten
years
of
such
an
environment
in
a
land
teeming
with
historic
traditions
rounded
out
the
man
who
set
his
face
toward
home
bent
on
redeeming
his
people
from
the
unjust
reproach
of
being
mere
"barbarians
of
the
North.
It
was
a
stricken
Denmark
to
which
he
came
back
Three
claimants
were
fighting
for
the
crown
The
land
was
laid
waste
by
sea-rovers
who
saw
their
chance
to
raid
defenceless
homes
while
the
men
able
to
bear
arms
were
following
the
rival
kings
The
people
had
lost
hope
Just
when
Absalon
returned
peace
was
made
between
the
claimants
Knud
Svend
and
Valdemar
his
foster
brother
of
old
divided
up
the
country
between
them
They
swore
a
dear
oath
to
keep
the
pact
but
for
all
that
"the
three
kingdoms
did
not
last
three
days.
The
treacherous
Svend
waited
only
for
a
chance
to
murder
both
his
rivals
and
it
came
quickly
when
he
and
Valdemar
were
the
guests
of
Knud
at
Roskilde
They
had
eaten
and
drunk
together
and
were
gathered
in
the
"Storstue,
the
big
room
of
the
house
when
Knud
saw
Svend
whispering
aside
with
his
men
With
a
sudden
foreboding
of
evil
he
threw
his
arms
about
Valdemar's
shoulders
and
kissed
him
The
young
King
who
was
playing
chess
with
one
of
his
men
looked
up
in
surprise
and
asked
what
it
meant
Just
then
Svend
left
the
hall
and
his
henchmen
fell
upon
the
two
with
drawn
swords
Knud
was
cut
down
at
once
his
head
cleft
in
twain
Valdemar
upset
the
table
with
the
candles
and
wrapping
his
cloak
about
his
arm
to
ward
off
the
blows
that
showered
upon
him
knocked
his
assailants
right
and
left
and
escaped
badly
wounded
Absalon
came
into
the
room
as
Knud
fell
and
thinking
it
was
Valdemar
caught
him
in
his
arms
and
took
his
wounded
head
in
his
lap
Sitting
there
in
utter
sorrow
and
despair
heedless
of
the
tumult
that
raged
in
the
darkness
around
him
he
felt
the
King's
garment
and
knew
that
the
man
who
was
breathing
his
last
in
his
arms
was
not
his
friend
He
laid
the
lifeless
body
down
gently
and
left
the
hall
The
murderers
barred
his
way
but
he
brushed
their
swords
and
spears
aside
and
strode
forth
unharmed
Valdemar
had
found
a
horse
and
made
for
Fjenneslev
twenty
miles
away
with
all
speed
and
there
Absalon
met
him
and
his
brother
Esbern
in
the
morning
King
Svend
sought
him
high
and
low
to
finish
his
dastardly
work
while
on
Thing
he
wailed
loudly
before
the
people
that
Valdemar
and
Knud
had
tried
to
kill
him
showing
in
proof
of
it
his
cloak
which
he
had
rent
with
his
own
sword
But
Valdemar's
friends
were
wide
awake
Esbern
flew
through
the
island
on
his
fleet
horse
in
Valdemar's
clothes
leading
his
pursuers
a
merry
dance
and
when
the
young
King's
wound
was
healed
he
found
him
a
boat
and
ferried
him
across
to
the
mainland
where
the
people
flocked
to
his
standard
When
Svend
would
have
followed
it
was
the
Lady
Inge
who
scuttled
his
ship
by
night
and
gave
her
foster
son
the
start
he
needed
There
followed
a
short
and
sharp
struggle
that
ended
on
Grathe
Heath
with
the
utter
rout
of
Svend's
forces
He
himself
was
killed
and
Valdemar
at
last
was
King
of
all
Denmark
From
that
time
the
three
friends
were
inseparable
as
in
the
old
days
when
they
played
about
the
fields
of
Fjenneslev
Absalon
was
the
keeper
of
the
King's
conscience
who
was
not
afraid
to
tell
him
the
truth
when
he
needed
to
hear
it
And
where
they
were
Esbern
was
found
never
wavering
in
his
loyalty
to
either
Within
a
year
Absalon
was
made
bishop
of
Roskilde
the
chief

King
Valdemar's
little
ruse
to
have
his
friend
chosen
He
was
yet
a
very
young
man
scarce
turned
thirty
and
had
not
been
considered
at
all
for
the
vacancy
There
were
three
candidates
all
of
powerful
families
and
according
to
ecclesiastical
law
the
brethren
of
the
chapter
were
the
electors
The
King
went
to
their
meeting
and
addressed
them
in
person
Nothing
was
farther
from
him
he
said
than
to
wish
to
interfere
with
their
proper
rights
Each
must
do
as
his
conscience
dictated
unhindered
And
with
that
he
laid
on
the
table
_four
books
with
blank
leaves
and
bade
them
write
down
their
names
in
them
each
for
his
own
choice
to
get
the
matter
right
on
the
record
The
brethren
thanked
him
kindly
and
all
voted
"nicely
together
for
Absalon
So
three
of
the
books
were
wasted
But
presently
Saxo
found
good
use
for
them
For
now
had
come
the
bishop's
chance
of
putting
in
practice
the
great
abbot's
precepts
"Pray
and
fight
was
the
motto
he
had
written
into
the
Knights
Templars
rule
and
Absalon
had
made
it
his
own
Of
what
use
was
it
to
build
up
the
church
at
home
when
any
day
might
see
it
raided
by
its
enemies
who
were
always
watching
their
chance
outside
The
Danish
waters
swarmed
with
pirates
the
very
pagans
against
whom
Abbot
Bernard
had
preached
his
crusade
Of
them
all
the
Wends
were
the
worst
as
they
were
the
most
powerful
of
the
Slav
tribes
that
still
resisted
the
efforts
of
their
neighbors
the
Christian
Germans
to
dislodge
them
from
their
old
home
on
the
Baltic
They
lived
in
the
island
of
Rügen
fairly
in
sight
of
the
Danish
shores
Every
favoring
wind
blew
them
across
the
sea
in
shoals
to
burn
and
ravage
The
Danes
once
the
terror
of
the
seas
had
given
over
roving
when
they
accepted
the
White
Christ
in
exchange
for
Thor
and
his
hammer
and
now
when
they
would
be
at
peace
they
were
in
turn
beset
by
this
relentless
enemy
who
burned
their
homes
and
their
crops
and
dragged
the
peaceful
husbandman
away
to
make
him
a
thrall
or
offer
him
up
as
a
sacrifice
to
heathen
idols
More
than
a
third
of
all
Denmark
lay
waste
under
their
ferocious
assault
Here
was
the
blow
to
be
struck
if
the
country
was
to
have
peace
and
the
church
prosperity
The
chance
to
strike
came
speedily
Absalon
had
been
bishop
only
a
few
months
when
on
the
evening
before
Palm
Sunday
word
was
brought
that
the
enemy
had
landed
twenty-four
ship-crews
strong
and
were
burning
and
murdering
as
usual
Absalon
marshalled
his
eighteen
house-carles
and
such
of
the
country-folk
as
he
could
and
fell
upon
the
Wends
routing
them
utterly
A
bare
handful
escaped
the
rest
were
killed
while
the
bishop
lost
but
a
single
man
He
said
mass
next
morning
red-handed
it
is
true
but
one
may
well
believe
that
for
all
that
his
Easter
message
reached
hearts
filled
with
a
new
glad
hope
for
their
homes
and
for
the
country
That
was
a
bishop
they
could
understand
So
the
first
blow
Absalon
struck
for
his
people
was
at
home
But
he
did
not
long
wait
for
the
enemy
to
come
to
him
Half
his
long
and
stirring
life
he
lived
on
the
seas
seeking
them
there
Saxo
mentions
in
speaking
of
his
return
from
one
of
his
cruises
that
he
had
then
been
nine
months
on
shipboard
And
in
a
way
he
was
shepherding
his
flock
there
if
it
was
with
a
scourge
for
many
years
before
a
Danish
king
had
punished
the
Wends
in
their
own
home
and
laid
their
lands
under
the
See
of
Roskilde
though
little
good
it
did
them
or
any
one
else
then
But
when
Absalon
had
got
his
grip
there
were
days
when
he
baptized
as
many
as
a
thousand
of
them
into
the
true
faith
He
was
not
altogether
alone
in
the
stand
he
took
Here
and
there
from
very
necessity
the
people
had
organized
to
resist
the
invaders
but
as
no
one
could
tell
where
they
would
strike
next
they
were
not
often
successful
and
fear
and
discouragement
sat
heavy
on
the
land
From
his
own
city
of
Roskilde
a
little
fleet
of
swift
sailers
under
the
bold
Wedeman
had
for
years
waged
relentless
war
upon
the
freebooters
and
had
taken
four
times
the
number
of
their
own
ships
Their
crews
were
organized
into
a
brotherhood
with
vows
like
an
order
of
fighting
monks
Before
setting
out
on
a
cruise
they
were
shriven
and
absolved
Their
vows
bound
them
to
unceasing
vigilance
to
live
on
the
plainest
of
fare
to
sleep
on
their
arms
ready
for
instant
attack
and
to
the
rescue
of
Christians
wherever
they
were
found
in
captivity
The
Roskilde
guild
became
the
strong
core
of
the
King's
armaments
in
his
score
of
campaigns
against
the
Wends
Perhaps
it
was
not
strange
that
Valdemar
should
be
of
two
minds
about
venturing
to
attack
so
formidable
an
enemy
in
his
own
house
The
nation
was
cowed
and
slow
to
move
In
fact
from
the
first
expedition
that
started
with
25
vessels
only
seven
returned
with
the
standard
keeping
up
a
running
fight
all
the
way
across
the
Baltic
with
pursuing
Wends
The
rest
had
basely
deserted
On
the
way
over
the
King
listening
to
their
doubts
and
fears
turned
back
himself
once
but
Absalon
who
always
led
in
the
attack
and
was
the
last
on
the
homeward
run
overtook
him
and
gave
him
the
talking
to
be
deserved
Saxo
who
was
very
likely
there
and
heard
for
there
is
little
doubt
that
he
accompanied
his
master
on
many
of
the
campaigns
he
so
vividly
describes
gives
us
a
verbatim
report
of
the
lecture
"What
wonder,
said
the
bishop
"if
the
words
stick
in
our
throats
and
are
nigh
to
stifling
us
when
such
grievous
dole
is
ours
Grieve
we
must
indeed
to
find
in
you
such
a
turncoat
that
naught
but
dishonor
can
come
of
it
You
follow
where
you
should
lead
and
those
you
should
rule
over
you
make
your
peers
There
is
nothing
to
stop
us
but
our
own
craven
souls
hunt
as
we
may
for
excuses
Is
it
with
such
laurel
you
would
bind
your
crown
with
such
high
deed
you
would
consecrate
your
reign?
The
King
was
hard
hit
and
showed
it
but
he
walked
away
without
a
word
In
the
night
a
furious
storm
swept
the
sea
and
kept
the
fleet
in
shelter
four
whole
days
during
which
Valdemar's
anger
had
time
to
cool
He
owned
then
that
Absalon
was
right
and
the
friends
shook
hands
The
King
gave
order
to
make
sail
as
soon
as
the
gale
abated
If
there
was
still
a
small
doubt
in
Absalon's
mind
as
he
turned
on
taking
leave
and
asked
"What
now
if
we
must
turn
back
once
more?
Valdemar
set
it
at
rest
"Then
you
write
me
from
Wendland,
he
laughed
"and
tell
me
how
things
are
there.
If
little
glory
or
gain
came
to
the
Danes
from
this
first
expedition
at
least
they
landed
in
the
enemy's
country
and
made
reprisal
for
past
tort
The
spirit
of
the
people
rose
and
shamed
them
for
their
cowardice
When
the
King's
summons
went
round
again
as
it
did
speedily
there
were
few
laggards
Attacked
at
home
the
Wends
lost
much
of
the
terror
they
had
inspired
Before
many
moons
the
chronicle
records
the
Danes
cut
their
spear-shafts
short
that
they
might
the
more
handily
get
at
the
foe
Scarce
a
year
passed
that
did
not
see
one
or
more
of
these
crusades
Absalon
preached
them
all
and
his
ship
was
ever
first
in
landing
In
battle
he
and
the
King
fought
shoulder
to
shoulder
In
the
spring
of
1169
he
had
at
last
his
wish
the
heathen
idols
were
destroyed
and
their
temples
burned
The
holy
city
of
the
Wends
Arcona
stood
on
a
steep
cliff
inaccessible
save
from
the
west
where
a
wall
a
hundred
feet
high
defended
it
While
the
sacred
banner
Stanitza
waved
over
it
the
Danes
might
burn
and
kill
but
the
power
of
Svantevit
was
unbroken
Svantevit
was
the
god
of
gods
in
whose
presence
his
own
priests
dared
not
so
much
as
breathe
When
they
had
to
they
must
go
to
the
door
and
breathe
in
the
open
a
good
enough
plan
if
Saxo's
disgust
at
the
filth
of
the
Wendish
homes
was
justified
Svantevit
was
a
horrid
monster
with
four
heads
and
girt
about
with
a
huge
sword
Up
till
then
the
Christian
arms
had
always
been
stayed
at
his
door
but
this
time
the
King
laid
siege
to
Arcona
determined
to
make
an
end
of
him
Some
of
the
youngsters
in
his
army
making
a
mock
assault
upon
the
strong
walls
discovered
an
accidental
hollow
under
the
great
tower
over
which
the
Stanitza
flew
and
seizing
upon
a
load
of
straw
that
was
handy
stuffed
it
in
and
set
it
on
fire
It
was
done
in
a
frolic
but
when
the
tower
caught
fire
and
was
burned
and
the
holy
standard
fell
Absalon
was
quick
to
see
his
advantage
and
got
the
King
to
order
a
general
assault
The
besieged
Wends
having
no
water
tried
to
put
out
the
fire
with
milk
but
says
the
chronicle
"it
only
fed
the
flames.
They
fought
desperately
till
between
fire
and
foe
they
were
seized
with
panic
and
calling
loudly
upon
Absalon
in
their
extremity
offered
to
give
up
their
city
The
army
clamored
for
the
revenge
that
was
at
last
within
their
grasp
and
the
King
hesitated
but
Absalon
met
the
uproar
firmly
reminding
them
that
they
had
crossed
the
seas
to
convert
the
heathen
not
to
sack
their
towns
The
city
was
allowed
to
surrender
and
the
people
were
spared
but
Svantevit
and
his
temple
were
destroyed
A
great
crowd
of
his
followers
had
gathered
to
see
him
crush
his
enemies
at
the
last
and
Absalon
cautioned
the
men
who
cut
the
idol
down
to
be
careful
that
he
did
not
fall
on
them
and
so
seem
to
justify
their
hopes
"He
fell
with
so
great
a
noise
that
it
was
a
wonder,
says
Saxo
naïvely
"and
in
the
same
moment
the
fiend
ran
out
of
the
temple
in
a
black
shape
with
such
speed
that
no
eye
could
follow
him
or
see
where
he
went.
Svantevit
was
dragged
out
of
the
town
and
chopped
into
bits
That
night
he
fed
the
fires
of
the
camp
So
fickle
is
popular
favor
that
when
the
crowd
saw
that
nothing
happened
they
spurned
the
god
loudly
before
whom
they
had
grovelled
in
the
dust
till
then
When
they
heard
of
Arcona's
fall
in
the
royal
city
of
Karents
they
hastened
with
offers
of
surrender
and
Absalon
went
there
with
a
single
ship's
crew
to
take
possession
They
were
met
by
600
armed
Wends
who
guarded
the
narrow
approach
to
the
city
In
single
file
they
walked
between
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
who
stood
with
inverted
spears
watching
them
in
sullen
silence
His
men
feared
a
trap
but
Absalon
strode
ahead
unmoved
Coming
to
the
temple
of
their
local
god
Rygievit
he
attacked
him
with
his
axe
and
bade
his
guard
fall
to
which
they
did
Saxo
has
left
us
a
unique
description
of
this
idol
that
stood
behind
purple
hangings
fashioned
of
oak
"in
every
evil
and
revolting
shape
The
swallows
had
made
their
nests
in
his
mouths
and
throats
(there
were
seven
in
so
many
faces
"and
filled
him
up
with
all
manner
of
stinking
uncleanness
Truly
for
such
god
was
such
sacrifice
fit.
He
had
a
sword
for
every
one
of
his
seven
faces
buckled
about
his
ample
waist
but
for
all
that
he
went
the
way
of
the
others
and
even
had
to
put
up
with
the
indignity
of
the
Christian
priests
standing
upon
him
while
he
was
being
dragged
out
That
seems
to
have
helped
cure
his
followers
of
their
faith
in
him
They
delivered
the
temple
treasure
into
the
hands
of
the
King--seven
chests
filled
with
money
and
valuables
among
them
a
silver
cup
which
the
wretched
King
Svend
had
sent
to
Svantevit
as
a
bribe
to
the
Wends
for
joining
him
against
his
own
country
and
kin
But
those
days
were
ended
It
was
the
Danes
turn
now
and
Wendland
was
laid
waste
until
"the
swallows
found
no
eaves
of
any
house
whereunder
to
build
their
nests
and
were
forced
to
build
them
on
the
ships.
A
sad
preliminary
to
bringing
the
country
under
the
rule
of
the
Prince
of
Peace
but
in
the
scheme
of
those
days
the
sword
was
equal
partner
with
the
cross
in
leading
men
to
the
true
God
The
heathen
temples
were
destroyed
and
churches
built
on
their
sites
of
the
timber
gathered
for
the
siege
of
Arcona
The
people
deserted
by
their
own
accepted
the
Christians
God
in
good
faith
and
were
baptized
in
hosts
thirteen
hundred
on
one
day
and
nine
hundred
on
the
next
Three
days
and
nights
Absalon
saw
no
sleep
He
did
nothing
half-way
No
sooner
was
he
back
home
than
he
sent
over
priests
and
teachers
supplied
with
everything
even
food
for
their
keep
so
that
they
"should
not
be
a
burden
to
the
people
whom
they
had
come
to
show
the
way
to
salvation.
The
Wends
were
conquered
but
the
end
was
not
yet
They
had
savage
neighbors
and
many
a
crusade
did
Absalon
lead
against
them
in
the
following
years
before
the
new
title
of
the
Danish
rulers
"King
of
the
Slavs
and
Wends,
was
much
more
than
an
empty
boast
He
organized
a
regular
sea
patrol
of
one-fourth
of
the
available
ships
of
which
he
himself
took
command
and
said
mass
on
board
much
oftener
than
in
the
Roskilde
church
It
is
the
sailor
the
warrior
the
leader
of
men
one
sees
through
all
the
troubled
years
of
his
royal
friend's
life
Now
the
Danish
fleet
is
caught
in
the
inland
sea
before
Stettin
unable
to
make
its
way
out
and
already
the
heathen
hosts
are
shouting
their
triumph
on
shore
It
is
Absalon
then
who
finds
the
way
and
as
one
would
expect
he
forces
it
The
captains
wail
over
the
trap
and
abuse
him
for
getting
them
into
it
Absalon
disdaining
to
answer
them
leads
his
ships
in
single
file
straight
for
the
gap
where
the
Wendish
fleet
lies
waiting
and
gets
the
King
to
attack
with
his
horsemen
on
shore
Between
them
the
enemy
is
routed
and
the
cowards
are
shamed
But
when
they
come
to
make
amends
he
is
as
unmoved
as
ever
and
will
have
none
of
it
Again
when
he
is
leading
his
men
to
the
attack
on
a
walled
town
a
bridge
upon
which
they
crowd
breaks
and
it
is
the
bishop
who

armor
Resting
in
his
castle
at
Haffn
the
present
Copenhagen
which
he
built
as
a
defence
against
the
sea-rovers
he
hears
while
in
his
bath
his
men
talking
of
strange
ships
that
are
sailing
into
the
Sound
and
hastily
throwing
on
his
clothes
gives
chase
and
kills
their
crews
for
they
were
pirates
whose
business
was
murder
and
they
merely
got
their
deserts
In
the
pursuit
his

Turn
the

of
Saxo's

we
find
him
under
Rügen
with
his
fleet
protecting
the
now
peaceful
Wendish
fishermen
in
their
autumn
herring-catch
on
which
their
livelihood
depended
Of

Esbern

found
too
earning
the

of
the
Fleet
(Snare)
which
the
people
had
fondly
given
to
their
favorite
Where
the
fighting
was
hardest
he
was
sure
to
be
The
King's
son
had
ventured
too
far
and
was
caught
in
a
tight
place
by
an
overwhelming
force
when
Esbern
pushed
his
ship
in
between
him
and
the
enemy
and
bore
the
brunt
of
a
fight
that
came
near
to
making
an
end
of
him
He
had
at
last
only
a
single
man
left
but
the
two
made
a
stand
against
a
hundred
"When
the
heathen
saw
his
face
they
fled
in
terror.
At
last
they
knocked
him
senseless
with
a
stone
and
would
have
killed
him
but
in
the
nick
of
time
the
King's
men
came
to
the
rescue
Coming
home
from
Norway
he
ran
afoul
of
forty
pirate
ships
under
the
coast
of
Seeland
He
tried
to
steal
past
forty
against
one
were
heavy
odds
But
it
was
moonlight
and
he
was
discovered
The
pirates
lay
across
his
course
and
cut
him
off
Esbern
made
ready
for
a
fight
and
steered
straight
into
the
middle
of
them
The
steersman
complained
that
he
had
no
armor
and
he
gave
him
his
own
He
beat
his
pursuers
off
again
and
again
but
the
wind
slackened
and
they
were
closing
in
once
more
swearing
by
their
heathen
gods
that
they
would
have
him
dead
or
alive
for
a
Danish
prisoner
on
one
of
their
ships
had
told
who
he
was
But
Esbern
had
more
than
one
string
to
his
bow
He
sent
a
man
aloft
with
flint
and
steel
to
strike
fire
in
the
top
and
the
pirates
believing
that
he
was
signalling
to
a
fleet
he
had
in
ambush
fled
helter-skelter
Esbern
got
home
safe
The
German
emperors
fingers
had
always
itched
for
the
over-lordship
of
the
Danish
isles
and
they
have
not
ceased
to
do
so
to
this
day
When
Frederick
Barbarossa
drove
Alexander
III
from
Rome
and
set
up
a
rival
Pope
in
his
place
Archbishop
Eskild
of
Lund
who
was
the
Primate
of
the
North
championed
the
exiled
Pope's
case
and
Valdemar
whose
path
the
ambitious
priest
had
crossed
more
than
once
let
it
be
known
that
he
inclined
to
the
Emperor's
cause
in
part
probably
from
mere
pique
perhaps
also
because
he
thought
it
good
politics
The
archbishop
in
a
rage
summoned
Absalon
and
bade
him
join
him
in
a
rising
against
the
King
Absalon's
answer
is
worthy
the
man
and
friend
"My
oath
to
you
I
will
keep
and
in
this
wise
that
I
will
not
counsel
you
to
your
own
undoing
Whatever
your
cause
against
the
King
war
against
him
you
cannot
and
succeed
And
this
know
that
never
will
I
join
with
you
against
my
liege
lord
to
whom
I
have
sworn
fealty
and
friendship
with
heart
and
soul
all
the
days
of
my
life.
He
could
not
persuade
the
archbishop
who
went
his
own
way
and
was
beaten
and
exiled
for
a
season
nor
could
he
prevent
the
King
from
yielding
to
the
blandishments
of
Frederick
and
getting
mixed
up
in
the
papal
troubles
but
he
went
with
him
to
Germany
and
saved
him
at
the
last
moment
from
committing
himself
by
making
him
leave
the
church
council
just
as
the
anti-pope
was
about
to
pronounce
sentence
of
excommunication
against
Alexander
He
commanded
Absalon
to
remain
as
a
servant
of
the
church
but
Absalon
replied
calmly
that
he
was
not
there
in
that
capacity
but
as
an
attendant
on
his
King
and
must
follow
where
he
went
It
appeared
speedily
that
the
Emperor's
real
object
was
to
get
Valdemar
to
own
him
as
his
over-lord
and
this
he
did
to
Absalon's
great
grief
on
the
idle
promise
that
Frederick
would
join
him
in
his
war
upon
all
the
Baltic
pagans
However
it
was
to
be
a
purely
personal
matter
in
nowise
affecting
his
descendants
That
much
was
saved
and
Absalon
lived
long
enough
to
fling
back
as
the
counsellor
of
Valdemar's
son
from
behind
the
stout
wall
he
built
at
Denmark's
southern
gate
the
Emperor's
demand
for
homage
with
the
reply
that
"the
King
ruled
in
Denmark
with
the
same
right
as
the
Emperor
in
Germany
and
was
no
man's
subject.
However
grievously
Absalon
had
offended
the
aged
archbishop
when
after
forty
years
in
his
high
office
illness
compelled
him
to
lay
it
down
he
could
find
no
one
so
worthy
to
step
into
his
shoes
He
sent
secretly
to
Rome
and
got
the
Pope's
permission
to
name
his
own
successor
before
he
called
a
meeting
of
the
church
The
account
of
what
followed
is
the
most
singular
of
all
Saxo's
stories
Valdemar
did
not
know
what
was
coming
and
fearing
fresh
trouble
got
the
archbishop
to
swear
on
the
bones
of
the
saints
before
them
all
that
he
was
not
moved
to
abdication
by
hate
of
the
King
or
by
any
coercion
whatever
Then
the
venerable
priest
laid
his
staff
his
mitre
and
his
ring
on
the
altar
and
announced
that
he
had
done
with
it
all
forever
But
he
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
use
the
power
given
him
by
the
Pontiff
They
might
choose
his
successor
themselves
He
would
do
nothing
to
influence
their
action
The
bishops
and
clergy
went
to
the
King
and
asked
him
if
he
had
any
choice
The
King
said
he
had
but
if
he
made
it
known
he
would
get
no
thanks
for
it
and
might
estrange
his
best
friend
If
he
did
not
he
would
certainly
be
committing
a
sin
He
did
not
know
what
to
do
"Name
him,
said
they
and
Valdemar
told
them
it
was
the
bishop
of
Roskilde
At
that
the
old
archbishop
got
up
and
insisted
on
the
election
then
and
there
but
Absalon
would
have
none
of
it
The
burden
was
too
heavy
for
his
shoulders
he
said
However
the
clergy
seized
him
"being,
says
Saxo
who
without
doubt
was
one
of
them
"the
more
emboldened
to
do
so
as
the
archbishop
himself
laid
hands
upon
him
first.
Intoning
the
hymn
sung
at
archiepiscopal
consecrations
they
tried
to
lead
him
to
the
altar
He
resisted
with
all
his
might
and
knocked
several
of
the
brethren
down
Vestments
were
torn
and
scattered
and
a
mighty
ruction
arose
to
which
the
laity
not
to
be
outdone
added
by
striking
up
a
hymn
of
their
own
Archbishop
and
King
tried
vainly
to
make
peace
the
clamor
and
battle
only
rose
the
higher
Despite
his
struggles
Absalon
was
dragged
to
the
high
seat
but
as
they
were
about
to
force
him
into
it
he
asked
leave
to
say
a
single
word
and
instantly
appealed
his
case
to
the
Pope
So
there
was
an
end
but
when
the
aged
Eskild
on
the
plea
of
weakness
begged
him
to
pronounce
the
benediction
he
refused
warily
because
so
he
would
be
exercising
archiepiscopal
functions
and
would
be
_de
facto
incumbent
of
the
office.[4
[Footnote
4
That
all
this
in
no
way
affected
the
personal
relations
of
the
two
men
Saxo
assures
us
in
one
of
the
little
human
touches
with
which
his
chronicle
abounds
When
Eskild
was
going
away
to
end
his
days
as
a
monk
in
the
monastery
of
Clairvaux
he
rested
awhile
with
Absalon
at
his
castle
Haffn
where
he
was
received
as
a
father
The
old
man
suffered
greatly
from
cold
feet
and
Absalon
made
a
box
with
many
little
holes
in
and
put
a
hot
brick
in
it
With
this
at
his
feet
Eskild
was
able
to
sleep
and
he
was
very
grateful
to
Absalon
both
because
of
the
comfort
it
gave
him
and
"because
that
he
perceived
that
filial
piety
rather
than
skill
in
the
healer's
art
prompted
the
invention.
Here
as
always
Absalon
thought
less
of
himself
than
of
his
country
so
the
event
showed
For
when
the
Pope
heard
his
plea
though
he
decided
against
him
he
allowed
him
to
hold
the
bishopric
of
Roskilde
together
with
the
higher
office
and
so
he
was
left
at
Valdemar's
side
to
help
finish
their
work
of
building
up
Denmark
within
and
without
At
Roskilde
he
spent
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
of
his
time
while
Valdemar
lived
At
Lund
he
would
have
been
in
a
distant
part
of
the
country
parted
from
his
friend
and
out
of
touch
with
the
things
that
were
the
first
concern
of
his
life
They
were
preparing
to
aim
a
decisive
blow
against
the
Pomeranian
pagans
when
Valdemar
died
on
the
very
day
set
for
the
sailing
The
parting
nearly
killed
Absalon
Saxo
draws
a
touching
picture
of
him
weeping
bitterly
as
he
said
the
requiem
mass
over
his
friend
and
observes
"Who
can
doubt
that
his
tears
rising
with
the
incense
gave
forth
a
peculiar
and
agreeable
savour
in
high
heaven
before
God?
The
plowmen
left
their
fields
and
carried
the
bier
with
sobs
and
lamentations
to
the
church
in
Ringsted
where
the
great
King
rests
His
sorrow
laid
Absalon
on
a
long
and
grievous
sick-bed
from
which
he
rose
only
when
Valdemar's
son
needed
and
called
him
In
the
fifteen
years
that
follow
we
see
his
old
warlike
spirit
still
unbroken
Thus
his
defiance
of
the
German
Emperor
whose
anger
was
hot
Frederick
in
revenge
persuaded
the
Pomeranian
duke
Bugislav
to
organize
a
raid
on
Denmark
with
a
fleet
of
five
hundred
sail
Scant
warning
reached
Absalon
of
the
danger
King
Knud
was
away
and
there
was
no
time
to
send
for
him
Mustering
such
vessels
as
were
near
he
sailed
across
the
Baltic
and
met
the
enemy
under
Rügen
the
day
after
Whitsuntide
(1184)
The
bishop
had
gone
ashore
to
say
mass
on
the
beach
when
word
was
brought
that
the
great
fleet
was
in
sight
Hastily
pulling
off
his
robe
and
donning
armor
instead
he
made
for
his
ship
with
the
words
"Now
let
our
swords
sing
the
praise
of
God.
The
Pomeranians
were
taken
completely
by
surprise
They
did
not
know
the
Danes
were
there
and
when
they
heard
the
archbishop's
dreaded
war-cry
raised
they
turned
and
fled
in
such
terror
and
haste
that
eighteen
of
their
ships
were
run
down
and
sunk
with
all
on
board
On
one
a
rower
hanged
himself
for
fear
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
Danes
Absalon
gave
chase
and
the
rout
became
complete
Of
the
five
hundred
ships
only
thirty-five
escaped
all
the
rest
were
either
sunk
or
taken
Duke
Bugislav
soon
after
became
a
vassal
of
Denmark
and
of
the
Emperor's
plots
there
was
an
end
It
was
the
last
blow
and
the
story
of
it
went
far
and
wide
Absalon's
work
was
nearly
done
Denmark
was
safe
from
her
enemies
The
people
were
happy
and
prosperous
Valdemar's
son
ruled
unchallenged
and
though
he
was
childless
by
his
side
stood
his
brother
a
manly
youth
who
not
yet
full
grown
had
already
shown
such
qualities
of
courage
and
sagacious
leadership
that
the
old
archbishop
could
hang
up
the
sword
with
heart
at
ease
The
promise
was
kept
The
second
Valdemar
became
Denmark's
royal
hero
for
all
time
Absalon's
last
days
were
devoted
to
strengthening
the
Church
around
which
he
had
built
such
a
stout
wall
He
built
churches
and
cloisters
and
guided
them
with
a
wise
and
firm
hand
And
he
made
Saxo
his
clerk
set
it
all
down
as
an
eye-witness
of
these
things
and
as
one
who
came
to
the
task
by
right
for
says
the
chronicler
"have
not
my
grandfather
and
his
father
before
him
served
the
King
well
on
land
and
sea
hence
why
should
not
I
serve
him
with
my
book-learning?
He
bears
witness
that
the
bishop
himself
is
his
authority
for
much
that
he
has
written
Archbishop
Absalon
closed
his
eyes
on
St
Benedict's
Day
March
21
1201
in
the
cloister
at
Sor
which
Sir
Asker
built
and
where
he
lived
his
last
days
in
peace
Absalon's
statue
of
bronze
on
horseback
battle-axe
in
hand
stands
in
the
market
square
in
Copenhagen
the
city
he
founded
and
of
which
he
is
the
patron
saint
but
his
body
lies
within
the
quiet
sanctuary
where
in
the
deep
forest
glades
one
listens
yet
for
the
evensong
of
the
monks
long
silent
now
When
his
grave
was
opened
in
1826
the
lines
of
his
tall
form
clad
in
clerical
robes
were
yet
clearly
traceable
The
strong
hands
turned
to
dust
held
a
silver
chalice
in
which
lay
his
episcopal
ring
They
are
there
to
be
seen
to-day
with
remnants
of
his
staff
that
had
partly
crumbled
away
No
Dane
approaches
his
grave
without
emotion
"All
Denmark
grieved
for
him,
says
a
German
writer
of
that
day
"and
commended
his
soul
to
Jesus
Christ
the
Prince
of
Peace
for
that
in
his
lifetime
he
had
led
many
who
were
enemies
to
peace
and
concord.
In
his
old
cathedral
in
Roskilde
town
lies
Saxo
according
to
tradition
under
an
unmarked
stone
When
he
went
to
rest
his
friend
and
master
had
slept
five
years
Esbern
outlived
his
brother
three
years
The
hero
of
so
many
battles
met
his
death
at
last
by
an
accidental
fall
in
his
own
house
The
last
we
hear
of
him
is
at
a
meeting
in
the
Christmas
season
1187
where
emissaries
of
Pope
Gregory
VIII
preached
a
general
crusade
Their
hearers
wept
at
the
picture
they
drew
of
the
sufferings
Christians
were
made
to
endure
in
the
Holy
Land
Then
arose
Esbern
and
reminded
them
of
the
great
deeds
of
the
fathers
at
home
and
abroad
The
faith
and
the
fire
of
Absalon
were
in
his
words
"These
things
they
did,
he
said
"for
the
glory
of
their
name
and
race
knowing
nothing
of
our
holy
religion
Shall
we
believing
do
less
Let
us
lay
aside
our
petty
quarrels
and
take
up
this
greater
cause
Let
us
share
the
sufferings
of
the
saints
and
earn
their
reward
Perhaps
we
shall
win--God
keeps
the
issue
Let
him
who
cannot
give
himself
give
of
his
means
So
shall
all
we
sharing
the
promise
share
also
the
reward.
The
account
we
have
says
that
many
took
the
cross
such
was
the
effect
of
his
words
more
likely
of
the
man
and
what
he
was
and
had
been
in
the
sight
of
them
all
throughout
his
long
life
KING
VALDEMAR
AND
THE
STORY
OF
THE
DANNEBROG
To
the
court
of
King
Ottocar
of
Bohemia
there
came
in
the
year
120
a
brilliant
embassy
from
far-off
Denmark
to
ask
the
hand
of
his
daughter
Dragomir
for
King
Valdemar
the
young
ruler
of
that
country
Sir
Strange[1
Ebbesön
and
Bishop
Peder
Sunesön
were
the
spokesmen
and
many
knights
whose
fame
had
travelled
far
in
the
long
years
of
fighting
to
bring
the
Baltic
pagans
under
the
cross
rode
with
them
The
old
king
received
them
with
delight
Valdemar
was
not

The

away
in

part

the
country
when
they
sent
to

Thus
the
folk-song
Long
before
Dagmar
went
to
her
rest
Bishop
Valdemar
had
stirred
up
all
Germany
to
wreak
his
vengeance
upon
the
King
He
was
an
ambitious
unscrupulous
priest
who
hated
his
royal
master
because
he
held
himself
entitled
to
the
crown
being
the
natural
son
of
King
Knud
who
was
murdered
at
Roskilde
as
told
in
the
story
of
Absalon
While
they
were
yet
young
men
when
he
saw
that
the
people
followed
his
rival
he
set
the
German
princes
against
Denmark
a
task
he
never
found
hard
But
young
Valdemar
made
short
work
of
them
He
took
the
strong
cities
on
the
Elbe
and
laid
the
lands
of
his
adversaries
under
the
Danish
crown
The
bishop
he
seized
and
threw
him
into
the
dungeon
of
Söborg
Castle
where
he
had
sat
thirteen
years
when
Dagmar's
prayers
set
him
free
He
could
hardly
walk
when
he
came
out
but
he
could
hate
and
all
the
world
knew
it
The
Pope
bound
him
with
heavy
oaths
never
to
return
to
Denmark
and
made
him
come
to
Italy
so
that
he
could
keep
an
eye
on
him
himself
But
two
years
had
not
passed
before
he
broke
his
oath
and
fled
to
Bremen
where
the
people
elected
him
to
the
vacant
archbishopric
and
its
great
political
power
Forthwith
he
began
plotting
against
his
native
land
In
the
bitter
feud
between
the
Guelphs
and
the
Ghibellines
he
found
his
opportunity
One
of
the
rival
emperors
marched
an
army
north
to
help
the
perjured
priest
King
Valdemar
hastened
to
meet
them
but
on
the
eve
of
battle
the
Emperor
was
slain
by
one
of
his
own
men
On
Sunday
when
the
archbishop
was
saying
mass
in
the
Bremen
cathedral
an
unknown
knight
the
visor
of
whose
helmet
was
closed
so
that
no
one
saw
his
face
strode
up
to
the
altar
and
laying
a
papal
bull
before
him
cried
out
that
he
was
accursed
and
under
the
ban
of
the
church
The
people
fled
and
forsaken
by
all
the
wretched
man
turned
once
more
to
Rome
in
submission
But
though
the
Pope
forgave
him
on
condition
that
he
meddle
no
more
with
politics
war
or
episcopal
office
another
summer
found
him
wielding
sword
and
lance
against
the
man
he
hated
this
time
under
the
banner
of
the
Guelphs
The
Germans
had
made
another
onset
on
Denmark
but
again
King
Valdemar
defeated
them
The
bishop
intrenched
himself
in
Hamburg
and
made
a
desperate
resistance
but
the
King
carried
the
city
by
storm
The
beaten
and
hopeless
man
fled
and
shut
himself
up
in
a
cloister
in
Hanover
where
daily
and
nightly
he
scourged
himself
for
his
sins
If
it
is
true
that
"hell
was
fashioned
by
the
souls
that
hated,
not
all
the
penance
of
all
the
years
must
have
availed
to
save
him
from
the
torments
of
the
lost
Denmark
now
had
peace
on
its
southern
border
Dagmar
was
dead
and
Valdemar
whose
restless
soul
yearned
for
new
worlds
to
conquer
turned
toward
the
east
where
the
wild
Esthland
tribes
were
guilty
of
even
worse
outrages
than
the
Wends
before
Absalon
tamed
them
The
dreadful
cruelties
practised
by
these
pagans
upon
christian
captives
cried
aloud
to
all
civilized
Europe
and
Valdemar
took
the
cross
"for
the
honor
of
the
Virgin
Mary
and
the
absolution
of
his
sins,
and
gathered
a
mighty
fleet
the
greatest
ever
assembled
in
Danish
waters
With
more
than
a
thousand
ships
he
sailed
across
the
Baltic
The
Pope
sped
them
with
his
apostolic
blessing
and
took
king
and
people
into
his
especial
care
forbidding
any
one
to
attack
the
country
while
they
were
away
converting
the
heathen
Archbishop
Anders
led
the
crusade
with
the
king
As
the
fleet
approached
the
shore
they
saw
it
covered
with
an
innumerable
host
of
the
enemy
So
great
was
their
multitude
that
the
crusaders
quailed
before
the
peril
of
landing
but
the
archbishop
put
heart
into
them
and
led
the
fleet
in
fervent
prayer
to
the
God
of
battle
Then
they
landed
without
hindrance
There
was
an
old
stronghold
there
called
Lyndanissa
that
had
fallen
into
decay
The
crusaders
busied
themselves
for
two
days
with
building
another
and
better
fort
On
the
third
day
being
St
Vitus
Day
they
rested
fearing
no
harm
The
Esthlanders
had
not
troubled
them
Some
of
their
chiefs
had
even
come
in
with
an
offer
of
surrender
They
were
willing
to
be
converted
they
said
and
the
priests
were
baptizing
them
after
vespers
while
the
camp
was
making
ready
for
the
night
when
suddenly
the
air
was
filled
with
the
yells
of
countless
savages
On
every
side
they
broke
from
the
woods
where
they
had
been
gathering
unsuspected
and
overwhelmed
the
camp
The
guards
were
hewn
down
the
outposts
taken
and
the
King's
men
were
falling
back
in
confusion
their
standard
lost
when
Prince
Vitislav
of
Rügen
who
had
been
camping
with
his
men
in
a
hollow
between
the
sand-hills
out
of
the
line
of
attack
threw
himself
between
them
and
the
Esthlanders
and
gave
the
Danes
time
to
form
their
lines
In
the
twilight
of
the
June
evening
the
battle
raged
with
great
fury
With
the
King
at
their
head
who
had
led
them
to
victory
on
so
many
hard-fought
fields
the
Danes
drove
back
their
savage
foes
time
after
time
literally
hewing
their
way
through
their
ranks
with
sword
and
battle-axe
But
they
were
hopelessly
outnumbered
Their
hearts
misgave
them
as
they
saw
ten
heathen
spring
out
of
the
ground
for
every
one
that
was
felled
The
struggle
grew
fiercer
as
night
came
on
The
Christians
were
fighting
for
life
defeat
meant
that
they
must
perish
to
a
man
by
the
sword
or
upon
pagan
altars
escape
there
was
none
Upon
the
cliff
overlooking
the
battle-field
the
archbishop
and
his
priests
were
praying
for
success
to
the
King's
arms
Tradition
that
has
been
busy
with
this
great
battle
all
through
the
ages
tells
how
while
the
aged
bishop's
hands
were
raised
toward
heaven
victory
leaned
to
the
Danes
but
when
he
grew
tired
and
let
them
fall
the
heathen
won
forward
until
the
priests
held
up
his
hands
and
once
more
the
tide
of
battle
rolled
back
from
the
shore
and
the
Christian
war-cry
rose
higher
Suddenly
in
the
clash
of
steel
upon
steel
and
the
wild
tumult
of
the
conflict
there
arose
a
great
and
wondering
cry
"the
banner
the
banner
a
miracle!
and
Christian
and
pagan
paused
to
listen
Out
of
the
sky
as
it
seemed
over
against
the
hill
upon
which
the
priests
knelt
a
blood-red
banner
with
a
great
white
cross
was
seen
falling
into
the
ranks
of
the
Christian
knights
and
a
voice
resounded
over
the
battle-field
"Bear
this
high
and
victory
shall
be
yours.
With
the
exultant
cry
"For
God
and
the
King,
the
crusaders
seized
it
and
charged
the
foe
Terror-stricken
the
Esthlanders
wavered
then
turned
and
fled
The
battle
became
a
massacre
Thousands
were
slain
The
chronicles
say
that
the
dead
lay
piled
fathom-high
on
the
field
that
ran
red
with
blood
Upon
it
when
the
pursuit
was
over
Valdemar
knelt
with
his
men
and
they
bowed
their
heads
in
thanksgiving
while
the
venerable
archbishop
gave
praise
to
God
for
the
victory
That
is
the
story
of
the
Dannebrog
which
has
been
the
flag
of
the
Danes
seven
hundred
years
Whether
the
archbishop
had
brought
it
with
him
intending
to
present
it
to
King
Valdemar
and
threw
it
down
among
the
fighting
hordes
in
the
moment
of
extreme
peril
or
whether
as
some
think
the
Pope
himself
had
sent
it
to
the
crusaders
with
a
happy
inspiration
the
fact
remains
that
it
came
to
the
Danes
in
this
great
battle
and
on
the
very
day
which
fifty
years
before
had
seen
the
fall
of
Arcona
and
the
end
of
idol-worship
among
the
western
Slavs
Three
hundred
years
the
standard
flew
over
the
Danes
fighting
on
land
and
sea
Then
it
was
lost
in
a
campaign
against
the
Holstein
counts
and
when
recovered
half
a
century
later
was
hung
up
in
the
cathedral
at
Slesvig
where
gradually
it
fell
to
pieces
In
the
first
half
of
the
Nineteenth
Century
when
national
feeling
and
national
pride
were
at
their
lowest
ebb
it
was
taken
down
with
other
moth-eaten
old
banners
one
day
when
they
were
cleaning
up
and
somebody
made
a
bonfire
of
them
in
the
street
Such
was
the
fate
of
"the
flag
that
fell
from
heaven,
the
sacred
standard
of
the
Danes
But
it
was
not
the
end
of
it
The
Dannebrog
flies
yet
over
the
Denmark
of
the
Valdemars
no
longer
great
as
then
it
is
true
nor
master
of
its
ancient
foes
but
the
world
salutes
it
with
respect
for
there
was
never
blot
of
tyranny
or
treason
upon
it
and
its
sons
own
it
with
pride
wherever
they
go
King
Valdemar
knighted
five
and
thirty
of
his
brave
men
on
the
battle-field
and
from
that
day
the
Order
of
the
Dannebrog
is
said
to
date
It
bears
upon
a
white
crusader's
cross
the
slogan
of
the
great
fight
"For
God
and
the
King,
and
on
its
reverse
the
date
when
it
was
won
"June
15
1219.
The
back
of
paganism
was
broken
that
day
and
the
conversion
of
all
Esthland
followed
soon
King
Valdemar
built
the
castle
he
had
begun
before
he
sailed
home
and
called
it
Reval
after
one
of
the
neighboring
tribes
The
Russian
city
of
that
name
grew
up
about
it
and
about
the
church
which
Archbishop
Anders
reared
The
Dannebrog
became
its
arms
and
its
people
call
it
to
this
day
"the
city
of
the
Danes.
Denmark
was
now
at
the
height
of
her
glory
Her
flag
flew
over
all
the
once
hostile
lands
to
the
south
and
east
clear
into
Russia
The
Baltic
was
a
Danish
inland
sea
King
Valdemar
was
named
"Victor
with
cause
His
enemies
feared
him
his
people
adored
him
In
a
single
night
foul
treachery
laid
the
whole
splendid
structure
low
The
King
and
young
Valdemar
Dagmar's
son
with
a
small
suite
of
retainers
had
spent
the
day
hunting
on
the
little
island
of
Lyö
Count
Henrik
of
Schwerin,--the
Black
Count
they
called
him,--who
had
just
returned
from
a
pilgrimage
to
the
Holy
Land
was
his
guest
The
count
hated
Valdemar
bitterly
for
some
real
or
fancied
injury
but
he
hid
his
hatred
under
a
friendly
bearing
and
smooth
speech
He
brought
the
King
gifts
from
the
Holy
Sepulchre
hunted
with
him
and
was
his
friend
But
by
night
when
the
King
and
his
son
slept
in
their
tent
unguarded
since
no
enemy
was
thought
to
be
near
he
fell
upon
them
with
his
cutthroats
bound
and
gagged
them
despite
their
struggles
and
gathering
up
all
the
valuables
that
lay
around
to
put
the
finishing
touch
upon
his
villainy
fled
with
his
prisoners
"in
great
haste
and
fear,
while
the
King's
men
slept
When
they
awoke
and
tried
to
follow
they
found
their
ships
scuttled
The
count's
boat
had
been
lying
under
sail
all
day
hidden
in
a
sheltered
cove
awaiting
his
summons
Germany
at
last
had
the
lion
and
its
whelp
in
her
grasp
In
chains
and
fetters
they
were
dragged
from
one
dungeon
to
another
The
traitors
dared
not
trust
them
long
in
any
city
however
strong
The
German
Emperor
shook
his
fist
at
Count
Henrik
but
secretly
he
was
glad
He
would
have
liked
nothing
better
than
to
have
the
precious
spoil
in
his
own
power
The
Pope
thundered
in
Rome
and
hurled
his
ban
at
the
thugs
But
the
Black
Count's
conscience
was
as
swarthy
as
his
countenance
and
besides
had
he
not
just
been
to
the
Holy
Land
and
thereby
washed
himself
clean
of
all
his
sins
past
and
present
Behind
prison
walls
comforted
only
by
Dagmar's
son
sat
the
King
growing
old
and
gray
with
anger
and
grief
Denmark
lay
prostrate
under
the
sudden
blow
while
her
enemies
rose
on
every
side
Day
by
day
word
came
of
outbreaks
in
the
conquered
provinces
The
people
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
the
strong
hand
that
held
the
helm
was
gone
and
the
ship
drifted
the
prey
of
every
ill
wind
It
was
as
if
all
that
had
been
won
by
sixty
years
of
victories
and
sacrifice
fell
away
in
one
brief
season
The
forests
filled
with
out-laws
neither
peasant
nor
wayfarer
nor
yet
monk
or
nun
in
their
quiet
retreat
was
safe
from
outrage
and
pirates
swarmed
again
in
bay
and
sound
where
for
two
generations
there
had
been
peace
The
twice-perjured
Bishop
Valdemar
left
his
cloister
cell
once
more
and
girt
on
the
sword
to
take
the
kingdom
he
coveted
by
storm
He
was
met
by
King
Valdemar's
kinsman
and
friend
Albert
of
Orlamunde
who
hastened
to
the
frontier
with
all
the
men
he
could
gather
They
halted
him
with
a
treaty
of
peace
that
offered
to
set
Valdemar
free
if
he
would
take
his
kingdom
as
a
fief
of
the
German
crown
He
Albert
so
it
was
written
was
to
keep
all
his
lands
and
more
would
he
but
sign
it
He
did
not
stop
to
hear
the
rest
but
slashed
the
parchment
into
ribbons
with
his
sword
and
ordered
an
instant
advance
The
bishop
he
made
short
work
of
and
he
was
heard
of
no
more
But
in
the
battle
with
the
German
princes
Albert
was
defeated
and
taken
prisoner
The
door
of
King
Valdemar's
dungeon
was
opened
only
to
let
his
friend
in
After
two
years
and
a
half
in
chains
Valdemar
was
ransomed
by
his
people
with
a
great
sum
of
gold
The
Danish
women
gave
their
rings
and
their
jewels
to
bring
back
their
king
They
flocked
about
him
when
he
returned
and
received
him
like
the
conqueror
of
old
but
he
rode
among
them
gray
and
stern
and
his
thoughts
were
far
away
They
had
made
him
swear
on
oath
upon
the
sacrament
and
all
Denmark's
bishops
with
him
before
they
set
him
free
that
he
would
not
seek
revenge
But
once
he
was
back
in
his
own
he
sent
to
Pope
Gregory
asking
him
to
loose
him
from
an
oath
wrung
from
him
while
he
was
helpless
in
the
power
of
bandits
And
the
Pope
responded
that
to
keep
faith
with
traitors
was
no
man's
duty
Then
back
he
rode
over
the
River
Eider
into
the
enemy's
land--for
they
had
stripped
Denmark
of
all
her
hard-won
possessions
south
of
the
ancient
border
of
the
kingdom
except
Esthland
and
Rügen--and
with
him
went
every
man
who
could
bear
arms
in
all
the
nation
He
crushed
the
Black
Count
who
tried
to
block
his
way
and
at
Bornhöved
met
the
German
allies
who
had
gathered
from
far
and
near
to
give
him
battle
Well
they
knew
that
if
Valdemar
won
the
reckoning
would
be
terrible
All
day
they
fought
and
victory
seemed
to
lean
toward
the
Danes
when
the
base
Holsteiners
the
Danish
rear-guard
whom
the
enemy
had
bought
to
betray
their
king
turned
their
spears
upon
his
army
and
decided
the
day
The
battle
ended
in
utter
rout
of
Valdemar's
forces
Four
thousand
Danish
men
were
slain
The
King
himself
fell
wounded
on
the
field
his
eye
pierced
by
an
arrow
and
would
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
once
more
but
for
an
unknown
German
knight
who
took
him
upon
his
horse
and
bore
him
in
the
night
over
unfrequented
paths
to
Kiel
where
he
was
safe
"But
all
men
said
that
this
great
hurt
befell
the
King
because
that
he
brake
the
oath
he
swore
upon
the
sacred
body
of
the
Lord.
The
wars
of
Valdemar
were
over
but
his
sorrows
were
not
Four
years
later
the
crushing
blow
fell
when
Dagmar's
son
who
was
crowned
king
to
succeed
him
lost
his
life
while
hunting
With
him
says
the
folk-song
died
the
hope
of
Denmark
The
King
had
other
sons
but
to
Dagmar's
boy
the
people
had
given
their
love
from
the
first
as
they
had
to
his
gentle
mother
The
old
King
and
his
people
grieved
together
But
Valdemar
rose
above
his
sorrows
Great
as
he
had
been
in
the
days
of
victory
he
was
greater
still
in
adversity
The
country
was
torn
by
the
wars
of
three-score
years
and
in
need
of
rest
He
gave
his
last
days
to
healing
the
wounds
the
sword
had
struck
Valdemar
the
Victor
became
Valdemar
the
Law-giver
The
laws
of
the
country
had
hitherto
made
themselves
They
were
the
outgrowths
of
the
people's
ancient
customs
passed
down
by
word
of
mouth
through
the
generations
and
confirmed
on
Thing
from
time
to
time
King
Valdemar
gave
Denmark
her
first
written
laws
that
judged
between
man
and
man
in
at
least
one
of
her
provinces
clear
down
into
our
day
"With
law
shall
land
be
built
begins
his
code
"The
law,
it
says
"must
be
honest
just
reasonable
and
according
to
the
ways
of
the
people
It
must
meet
their
needs
and
speak
plainly
so
that
all
men
may
know
and
understand
what
the
law
is
It
is
not
to
be
made
in
any
man's
favor
but
for
the
needs
of
all
them
who
live
in
the
land.
That
is
its
purpose
and
"no
man
shall
judge
(condemn
the
law
which
the
King
has
given
and
the
country
chosen
neither
shall
he
(the
King
take
it
back
without
the
will
of
the
people.
That
tells
the
story
of
Valdemar's
day
and
of
the
people
who
are
so
near
of
kin
with
ourselves
They
were
not
sovereign
and
subjects
they
were
a
chosen
king
and
a
free
people
working
together
"with
law
land
to
build.
King
Valdemar
was
married
twice
The
folk-song
represents
Dagmar
as
urging
the
King
with
her
dying
breath
"that
Bengerd
my
lord
that
base
bad
dame
you
never
to
wife
will
take.
Bengerd
or
Berengaria
was
a
Portuguese
princess
whom
Valdemar
married
in
spite
of
the
warning
two
years
later
As
the
people
had
loved
the
fair
Dagmar
so
they
hated
the
proud
Southern
beauty
whether
with
reason
or
not
The
story
of
her
"morning
gift,
as
it
has
come
down
to
us
through
the
mists
of
time
is
very
different
from
the
other
She
asks
the
King
so
the
ballad
has
it
to
give
her
Samsö
a
great
and
fertile
island
and
"a
golden
crown[3
for
every
maid,
but
he
tells
her
not
to
be
quite
so
greedy
There
be
full
many
an
honest
maid
with
not
dry
bread
to
eat
[Footnote
3
A
coin
probably.
Undismayed
Bengerd
objects
that
Danish
women
have
no
business
to
wear
silken
gowns
and
that
a
good
horse
is
not
for
a
peasant
lad
The
King
replies
patiently
that
what
a
woman
can
buy
she
may
wear
for
him
and
that
he
will
not
take
the
lad's
horse
if
he
can
feed
it
Bengerd
is
not
satisfied
"Let
bar
the
land
with
iron
chains
is
her
next
proposal
that
neither
man
nor
woman
enter
it
without
paying
tax
Her
husband
says
scornfully
that
Danish
kings
have
never
had
need
of
such
measures
and
never
will
He
is
plainly
getting
bored
and
when
she
keeps
it
up
and
begrudges
the
husbandman
more
than
"two
oxen
and
a
cow,
he
loses
his
temper
and
presumably
there
is
a
matrimonial
tiff
Very
likely
most
of
this
is
fiction
bred
of
the
popular
prejudice
The
King
loved
her
that
is
certain
She
was
a
beautiful
high-spirited
woman
so
beautiful
that
many
hundreds
of
years
after
when
her
grave
was
opened
the
delicate
oval
of
her
skull
excited
admiration
yet
But
the
people
hated
her
Twenty
generations
after
her
death
it
was
their
custom
when
passing
her
grave
to
spit
on
it
with
the
exclamation
"Out
upon
thee
Bengerd
God
bless
the
King
of
Denmark"
for
in
good
or
evil
days
they
never
wavered
in
their
love
and
admiration
for
the
king
who
was
a
son
of
the
first
Valdemar
and
the
heir
of
his
greatness
and
of
that
of
the
sainted
Absalon
Tradition
has
it
that
Bengerd
was
killed
in
battle
having
gone
with
her
husband
on
one
of
his
campaigns
"It
was
not
heard
in
any
place,
says
the
folk-song
wickedly
"that
any
one
grieved
for
her.
But
the
King
mourned
for
his
beautiful
queen
to
the
end
of
his
days
Bengerd
bore
Valdemar
three
sons
upon
whom
he
lavished
all
the
affection
of
his
lonely
old
age
Erik
he
chose
as
his
successor
and
to
keep
his
brothers
loyal
to
him
he
gave
them
great
fiefs
and
thus
unknowing
brought
on
the
very
trouble
he
sought
to
avoid
and
set
his
foot
on
the
path
that
led
to
Denmark's
dismemberment
after
centuries
of
bloody
wars
For
to
his
second
son
Abel
he
gave
Slesvig
and
Abel
when
his
brother
became
king
sought
alliance
with
the
Holstein
count
Adolf,[4
the
very
one
who
had
led
the
Germans
at
the
fatal
battle
of
Bornhöved
The
result
was
a
war
between
the
brothers
that
raged
seven
years
and
laid
waste
the
land
Worse
was
to
follow
for
Abel
was
only
"Abel
in
name
but
Cain
in
deed.
But
happily
the
old
King's
eyes
were
closed
then
and
he
was
spared
the
sight
of
one
brother
murdering
the
other
for
the
kingdom
[Footnote
4
That
was
the
beginning
of
the
Slesvig-Holstein
question
that
troubled
Europe
to
our
day
for
the
fashion
set
by
Abel
other
rulers
of
his
dukedom
followed
and
by
degrees
Slesvig
came
to
be
reckoned
with
the
German
duchies
whereas
up
till
then
it
had
always
been
South-Jutland
a
part
of
Denmark
proper.
Some
foreboding
of
this
seems
to
have
troubled
him
in
his
last
years
It
is
related
that
once
when
he
was
mounting
his
horse
to
go
hunting
he
fell
into
a
deep
reverie
and
remained
standing
with
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
a
long
time
while
his
men
wondered
not
daring
to
disturb
him
At
last
one
of
them
went
to
remind
him
that
the
sun
was
low
in
the
west
The
King
awoke
from
his
dream
and
bade
him
go
at
once
to
a
wise
old
hermit
who
lived
in
a
distant
part
of
the
country
"Ask
him,
he
said
"what
King
Valdemar
was
thinking
of
just
now
and
bring
me
his
answer.
The
knight
went
away
on
his
strange
errand
and
found
the
hermit
And
this
was
the
message
he
brought
back
"Your
lord
and
master
pondered
as
he
stood
by
his
horse
how
his
sons
would
fare
when
he
was
dead
Tell
him
that
war
and
discord
they
shall
have
but
kings
they
will
all
be.
When
the
King
heard
the
prophecy
he
was
troubled
in
mind
and
called
his
sons
and
all
his
great
knights
to
a
council
at
which
he
pleaded
with
them
to
keep
the
peace
But
though
they
promised
he
was
barely
in
his
grave
when
riot
and
bloodshed
filled
the
land
The
climax
was
reached
when
Abel
inveigled
his
brother
to
his
home
with
fair
words
and
once
he
had
him
in
his
power
seized
him
and
gave
him
over
to
his
men
to
do
with
"as
they
pleased.
They
understood
their
master
only
too
well
and
took
King
Erik
out
on
the
fjord
in
an
open
boat
and
killed
him
there
scarce
giving
him
time
to
say
his
prayers
They
weighted
his
body
with
his
helmet
and
sank
it
in
the
deep
Abel
made
oath
with
four
and
twenty
of
his
men
that
he
was
innocent
of
his
brother's
blood
and
took
the
crown
after
him
But
the
foul
crime
was
soon
avenged
Within
a
few
years
he
was
himself
slain
by
a
peasant
in
a
rising
of
his
own
people
For
a
while
his
body
lay
unburied
the
prey
of
beast
and
bird
and
when
it
was
interred
in
the
Slesvig
cathedral
there
was
no
rest
for
it
"Such
turmoil
arose
in
the
church
by
night
that
the
monks
could
not
chant
their
vigils,
and
in
the
end
they
took
him
out
and
buried
him
in
a
swamp
with
a
stake
driven
through
the
heart
to
lay
his
ghost
But
clear
down
to
our
time
when
people
ceased
to
believe
in
ghosts
the
fratricide
was
seen
at
night
hunting
through
the
woods
coal-black
and
on
a
white
horse
with
three
fiery
dogs
trailing
after
and
blue
flames
burned
over
the
sea
where
they
vanished
That
was
how
the
superstition
of
the
people
judged
the
man
whom
the
nobles
and
the
priests
made
king
red-handed
Christopher
the
youngest
of
the
three
brothers
was
king
last
His
end
was
no
better
than
that
of
the
rest
Indeed
it
was
worse
Hardly
yet
forty
years
old
he
died--poisoned
it
was
said
by
the
Abbot
Arnfast
in
the
sacrament
as
he
knelt
at
the
altar-rail
in
the
Ribe
cathedral
He
was
buried
in
the
chancel
where
the
penitents
going
to
the
altar
walk
over
his
grave
So
of
all
Valdemar's
four
sons
not
one
died
a
peaceful
natural
death
But
kings
they
all
were
Valdemar
was
laid
in
Ringsted
with
his
great
father
He
sleeps
between
his
two
queens
Dagmar's
grave
was
disturbed
in
the
late
middle
ages
by
unknown
vandals
and
the
remains
of
Denmark's
best-loved
queen
were
scattered
Only
a
golden
cross
which
she
had
worn
in
life
somehow
escaped
and
found
its
way
in
course
of
time
into
the
museum
of
antiquities
at
Copenhagen
where
it
now
is
its
chief
and
priceless
treasure
There
also
is
a
braid
of
Queen
Bengerd's
hair
that
was
found
when
her
grave
was
opened
in
1855
The
people's
hate
had
followed
her
even
there
and
would
not
let
her
rest
The
slab
that
covered
her
tomb
had
been
pried
off
and
a
round
stone
dropped
into
the
place
made
for
her
head
Otherwise
her
grave
was
undisturbed
"Truly
then
fell
the
crown
from
the
heads
of
Danish
men,
says
the
old
chronicle
of
King
Valdemar's
death
and
black
clouds
were
gathering
ominously
even
then
over
the
land
But
in
storm
and
stress
as
in
days
that
were
fair
the
Danish
people
have
clung
loyally
to
the
memory
of
their
beloved
King
and
of
his
sweet
Dagmar
HOW
THE
GHOST
OF
THE
HEATH
WAS
LAID
On
the
map
of
Europe
the
mainland
of
Denmark
looks
like
a
beckoning
finger
pointing
due
north
and
ending
in
a
narrow
sand-reef
upon
which
the
waves
of
the
North
Sea
and
of
the
Kattegat
break
with
unceasing
clamor
and
strife
The
heart
of
the
peninsula
quite
one-fourth
of
its
area
was
fifty
years
ago
a
desert
a
barren
melancholy
waste
where
the
only
sign
of
life
encountered
by
the
hunter
gunning
for
heath-fowl
and
plover
was
a
rare
shepherd
tending
a
few
lonesome
sheep
and
knitting
mechanically
on
his
endless
stocking
The
two
the
lean
sheep
and
the
long
stocking
together
comprised
the
only
industries
which
the
heath
afforded
and
was
thought
capable
of
sustaining
A
great
change
has
taken
place
within
the
span
of
a
single
life
and
it
is
all
due
to
the
clear
sight
and
patient
devotion
of
one
strong
man
the
Gifford
Pinchot
of
Denmark
The
story
of
that
unique
achievement
reads
like
the
tale
of
the
Sleeping
Beauty
who
was
roused
from
her
hundred
years
sleep
by
the
kiss
of
her
lover
prince
The
prince
who
awoke
the
slumbering
heath
was
a
captain
of
engineers
Enrico
Dalgas
by
name
Not
altogether
fanciful
is
the
conceit
Barren
black
and
desolate
the
great
moor
gripped
the
imagination
as
no
smiling
landscape
of
field
and
forest
could--does
yet
where
enough
of
it
remains
Far
as
eye
reaches
the
dun
heather
covers
hill
and
plain
with
its
sombre
pall
Like
gloomy
sentinels
furry
cattails
nod
in
the
bog
where
the
blue
gentian
peeps
timidly
into
murky
pools
the
only
human
habitation
in
sight
some
heath
boer's
ling-thatched
hut
flanked
by
rows
of
peat
stacks
in
vain
endeavor
to
stay
the
sweep
of
the
pitiless
west
wind
On
the
barrows
where
the
vikings
sleep
their
long
sleep
the
plover
pipes
its
melancholy
lay
between
steep
banks
a
furtive
brook
steals
swiftly
by
as
if
anxious
to
escape
from
the
universal
blight
Over
it
all
broods
the
silence
of
the
desert
drowsy
with
the
hum
of
many
bees
winging
their
swift
way
to
the
secret
feeding-places
they
know
of
where
mayflower
and
anemone
hide
under
the
heather
witness
that
forests
grew
here
in
the
long
ago
In
midsummer
when
the
purple
is
on
the
broom
a
strange
pageant
moves
on
the
dim
horizon
a
shifting
mirage
of
sea
and
shore
forest
lake
and
islands
lying
high
with
ships
and
castles
and
spires
of
distant
churches--the
witchery
of
the
heath
that
speaks
in
the
tales
and
superstitions
of
its
simple
people
High
in
the
blue
soars
the
lark
singing
its
song
of
home
and
hope
to
its
nesting
mate
This
is
the
heath
which
denying
to
the
hardest
toil
all
but
the
barest
living
has
given
of
its
poetry
to
the
Danish
tongue
some
of
its
sweetest
songs
But
in
this
busy
world
day-dreams
must
make
way
for
the
things
that
make
the
day
count
castles
in
the
air
to
homes
upon
the
soil
The
heath
had
known
such
in
the
dim
past
It
had
not
always
been
a
desert
The
numberless
cairns
that
lie
scattered
over
it
sometimes
strung
out
for
miles
as
if
marking
the
highways
of
the
ancients
which
they
doubtless
do
sometimes
grouped
where
their
villages
stood
bear
witness
to
it
Great
battles
account
for
their
share
and
some
of
them
were
fought
in
historic
times
On
Grathe
Heath
the
young
King
Valdemar
overcame
his
treacherous
rival
Svend
Alone
and
hunted
the
beaten
man
sought
refuge
Saxo
tells
us
behind
a
stump
where
he
was
found
and
slain
by
one
of
the
King's
axemen
A
chapel
was
built
on
the
spot
More
than
seven
centuries
later
(in
1892
they
dug
there
and
found
the
bones
of
a
man
with
skull
split
in
two
The
stump
behind
which
the
wretched
Svend
hid
was
probably
the
last
representative
of
great
forests
that
grew
where
now
is
sterile
moor
In
the
bogs
trunks
of
oak
and
fir
are
found
lying
as
they
fell
centuries
ago
The
local
names
preserve
the
tradition
with
here
and
there
patches
of
scrub
oak
that
hug
the
ground
close
to
escape
the
blast
from
the
North
Sea
There
is
one
such
thicket
near
the
hamlet
of
Taulund--the
name
itself
tells
of
long-forgotten
groves--and
the
story
runs
among
the
people
yet
that
once
squirrels
jumped
from
tree
to
tree
without
touching
ground
all
the
way
from
Taulund
to
Gjellerup
church
a
stretch
of
more
than
five
miles
to
which
the
wild
things
of
the
woods
have
long
been
strangers
In
the
shelter
of
the
old
forests
men
dwelt
through
ages
and
made
the
land
yield
them
a
living
Some
cairns
that
have
been
explored
span
over
more
than
a
thousand
years
They
were
built
in
the
stone
age
and
served
the
people
of
the
bronze
and
iron
ages
successively
as
burial-places
doubtless
the
same
tribes
who
thus
occupied
their
homesteads
from
generation
to
generation
That
they
were
farmers
not
nomads
is
proved
by
the
clear
impression
of
grains
of
wheat
and
barley
in
their
burial
urns
The
seeds
strayed
into
the
clay
and
were
burned
away
but
the
impression
abides
and
tells
the
story
Clear
down
to
historic
times
there
was
a
thrifty
population
in
many
of
the
now
barren
spots
But
a
change
was
slowly
creeping
over
the
landscape
The
country
was
torn
by
long
and
bloody
wars
The
big
men
fought
for
the
land
and
the
little
ones
paid
the
score
as
they
always
do
They
were
hunted
from
house
and
home
Next
the
wild
hordes
of
the
Holstein
counts
overran
Jutland
Its
towns
were
burned
the
country
laid
waste
Great
fires
swept
the
forests
What
ravaging
armies
had
left
was
burned
in
the
smelteries
In
the
sandy
crust
of
the
heath
there
is
iron
and
swords
and
spears
were
the
grim
need
of
that
day
The
smelteries
are
only
names
now
They
went
but
they
took
the
forests
with
them
and
where
the
ground
was
cleared
the
west
wind
broke
through
and
ruin
followed
fast
Last
of
all
came
the
Black
Death
and
set
its
seal
of
desolation
upon
it
all
When
it
had
passed
the
country
was
a
huge
graveyard
The
heath
had
moved
in
Rovers
and
smugglers
found
refuge
there
honest
folk
shunned
it
Under
the
heather
the
old
landmarks
are
sometimes
found
yet
and
deep
ruts
made
by
wheels
that
long
since
ceased
to
turn
In
the
Eighteenth
Century
men
began
to
think
of
reclamation
A
thousand
German
colonists
were
called
in
and
settled
on
the
heath
but
it
was
stronger
than
they
and
they
drifted
away
until
scarce
half
a
hundred
families
remained
The
Government
tried
its
hand
but
there
was
no
one
who
knew
just
how
and
only
discouragement
resulted
Then
came
the
war
with
Germany
in
1864
that
lost
to
Denmark
a
third
of
her
territory
The
country
lay
prostrate
under
the
crushing
blow
But
it
rose
above
defeat
and
disaster
and
once
more
expectant
eyes
were
turned
toward
the
ancient
domain
that
had
slipped
from
its
grasp
"What
was
lost
without
must
be
won
within
became
the
national
slogan
And
this
time
the
man
for
the
task
was
at
hand
Enrico
Mylius
Dalgas
was
by
the
accident
of
birth
an
Italian
his
father
being
the
Danish
consul
in
Naples
by
descent
a
Frenchman
by
choice
and
training
a
Dane
typical
of
the
best
in
that
people
He
came
of
the
Huguenot
stock
that
left
France
after
the
repeal
of
the
Edict
of
Nantes
in
168
and
scattered
over
Europe
to
the
great
good
of
every
land
in
which
it
settled
They
had
been
tillers
of
the
soil
from
the
beginning
and
at
least
two
of
the
family
who
found
homes
in
Denmark
made
in
their
day
notable
contributions
to
the
cause
of
advanced
sensible
husbandry
Enrico's
father
though
a
merchant
had
an
open
eye
for
the
interests
which
in
later
years
claimed
the
son's
life-work
In
the
diary
of
a
journey
through
Sweden
he
makes
indignant
comment
upon
the
reckless
way
in
which
the
people
of
that
country
dealt
with
their
forests
That
he
was
also
a
man
of
resolution
is
shown
by
an
incident
of
the
time
when
Jew-baiting
was
having
its
sorry
day
in
Denmark
An
innkeeper
mistook
the
dark-skinned
little
man
for
a
Jew
and
set
before
him
a
spoiled
ham
retorting
contemptuously
when
protest
was
made
that
it
was
"good
enough
for
a
Sheeny.
Without
further
parley
Mr
Dalgas
seized
the
hot
ham
by
its
shank
and
beat
the
fellow
with
it
till
he
cried
for
mercy
The
son
tells
of
the
first
school
he
attended
when
he
was
but
five
years
old
It
was
kept
by
the
widow
of
one
of
Napoleon's
generals
a
militant
lady
who
every
morning
marshalled
the
school
a
Lilliputian
army
with
the
teachers
flanking
the
line
like
beardless
sergeants
in
stays
and
petticoats
and
distributed
rewards
and
punishments
as
the
great
Emperor
was
wont
to
do
after
a
battle
For
the
dunces
there
was
a
corner
strewn
with
dried
peas
on
which
they
were
made
to
kneel
with
long-eared
donkey
caps
adorning
their
luckless
heads
Very
likely
it
was
after
an
insult
of
this
kind
that
Enrico
decided
to
elope
to
America
with
his
baby
sister
They
were
found
down
by
the
harbor
bargaining
with
some
fishermen
to
take
them
over
to
Capri
_en
route
for
the
land
of
freedom
The
elder
Dalgas
died
while
the
children
were
yet
little
and
the
widow
went
back
to
Denmark
to
bring
up
her
boys
there
They
were
poor
and
the
change
from
the
genial
skies
of
sunny
Italy
to
the
bleak
North
did
not
make
it
any
easier
for
them
Enrico's
teacher
saw
it
and
gave
him
his
overcoat
to
be
made
over
But
the
boys
spotted
it
and
squared
accounts
with
their
teacher
by
snowballing
the
wearer
of
the
big
green
plaid
until
he
was
glad
to
leave
it
at
home
and
go
without
He
was
in
the
military
school
when
war
broke
out
with
Germany
in
1848
Both
of
his
brothers
volunteered
and
fell
in
battle
Enrico
was
ordered
out
as
lieutenant
and
put
on
the
shoulder-straps
joyfully
to
the
great
scandal
of
his
godfather
in
Milan
who
sympathized
with
the
German
cause
When
the
young
soldier
refused
to
resign
he
not
only
cut
him
off
in
his
will
but
took
away
a
pension
of
four
hundred
kroner
he
had
given
his
mother
in
her
widowhood
If
he
had
thoughts
of
bringing
them
over
by
such
means
he
found
out
his
mistake
Mother
and
son
were
made
of
sterner
stuff
Dalgas
fought
twice
for
his
country
the
last
time
in
1864
as
a
captain
of
engineers
It
was
no
ordinary
class
the
one
of
185
that
resumed
its
studies
in
the
military
high
school
Two
of
the
students
did
not
answer
roll-call
their
names
were
written
among
the
nation's
heroic
dead
Some
had
scars
and
wore
the
cross
for
valor
in
battle
All
were
first
lieutenants
to
be
graduated
as
captains
Dalgas
had
himself
transferred
from
the
artillery
to
the
engineers
and
was
detailed
as
road
inspector
So
the
opportunity
of
his
life
came
to
him
There
were
few
railways
in
those
days
the
highways
were
still
the
great
arteries
of
traffic
Dalgas
built
roads
that
crossed
the
heath
and
he
learned
to
know
it
and
the
strong
and
independent
if
narrow
people
who
clung
to
it
with
such
a
tenacious
grip
He
had
a
natural
liking
for
practical
geology
and
for
the
chemistry
of
the
soil
and
the
deep
cuts
which
his
roads
sometimes
made
gave
him
the
best
of
chances
for
following
his
bent
The
heath
lay
as
an
open
book
before
him
and
he
studied
it
with
delight
He
found
the
traces
of
the
old
forests
and
noted
their
extent
Occasionally
the
pickaxe
uncovered
peat
deposits
of
unsuspected
depth
and
value
Sometimes
the
line
led
across
the
lean
fields
and
damages
had
to
be
discussed
and
assessed
He
learned
the
point
of
view
of
the
heath
farmer
sympathized
with
his
struggles
and
gained
his
confidence
Best
of
all
he
found
a
man
of
his
own
mind
a
lawyer
by
the
name
of
Morville
himself
a
descendant
of
the
exiled
Huguenots
It
is
not
a
little
curious
that
when
the
way
was
cleared
for
the
Heath
Society's
great
work
in
its
formal
organization
with
M
Mourier-Petersen
a
large
landowner
as
their
associate
in
its
management
the
three
men
who
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
planned
the
work
and
marked
out
the
groove
in
which
it
was
to
run
were
all
of
that
strong
stock
which
is
by
no
means
the
most
common
in
Denmark
With
his
lawyer
friend
Captain
Dalgas
tramped
the
heath
far
and
wide
for
ten
years
Then
their
talks
had
matured
a
plan
Dalgas
wrote
to
the
Copenhagen
newspapers
that
the
heath
could
be
reclaimed
and
suggested
that
it
should
be
done
by
the
State
They
laughed
at
him
"Nothing
better
could
have
happened,
he
said
in
after
years
"for
it
made
us
turn
to
the
people
themselves
and
that
was
the
road
to
success
though
we
did
not
know
it.
In
the
spring
of
186
a
hundred
men
little
and
big
landowners
most
of
them
met
at
his
call
and
organized
the
Heath
Society[1
with
the
object
of
reclaiming
the
moor
Dalgas
became
its
managing
director
[Footnote

Danske
Hedeselskab.
To
restore
to
the
treeless
waste
its
forest
growth
was
the
fundamental
idea
for
until
that
was
done
nothing
but
the
heather
could
grow
there
The
west
wind
would
not
let
it
But
the
heath
farmer
shook
his
head
It
would
cost
too
much
and
give
too
little
back
What
he
needed
was
water
and
marl
Could
the
captain
help
them
to
these?--that
was
another
matter
The
little
streams
that
found
their
way
into
the
heath
and
lost
it
there
dire
need
had
taught
them
to
turn
to
use
in
their
fields
not
a
drop
escaped
But
the
river
that
ran
between
deep
banks
was
beyond
their
reach
Could
he
show
them
how
to
harness
that
Dalgas
saw
their
point
"We
are
working
not
for
the
dead
soil
but
for
the
living
men
who
find
homes
upon
it,
he
told
his
associates
and
tree
planting
was
put
aside
for
the
time
They
turned
canal
diggers
instead
Irrigation
became
their
aim
and
task
the
engineer
was
in
his
right
place
The
water
was
raised
from
the
stream
and
led
out
upon
the
moor
and
presently
grass
grew
in
the
sand
which
the
wiry
stems
of
the
heather
had
clutched
so
long
Green
meadows
lined
the
water-runs
and
fragrant
haystacks
rose
To
the
lean
sheep
was
added
a
cow
then
two
The
farmer
laid
by
a
little
and
took
in
more
land
for
cultivation
That
meant
breaking
the
heath
Also
it
meant
marl
The
heath
is
lime-poor
marl
is
lime
in
the
exact
form
in
which
it
best
fits
that
sandy
soil
It
was
known
to
exist
in
some
favored
spots
but
the
poor
heath
farmer
could
not
bring
it
from
a
distance
So
the
marl
borer
went
with
the
canal
digger
Into
every
acre
he
drove
his
auger
and
mapped
out
his
discoveries
At
last
accounts
he
had
found
marl
in
more
than
seventeen
hundred
places
and
he
is
not
done
yet
Where
there
was
none
Dalgas's
Society
built
portable
railways
into
the
moor
far
enough
to
bring
it
to
nearly
every
farmer's
door
It
was
as
if
a
magic
wand
had
been
waved
over
the
heath
With
water
and
marl
the
means
were
at
hand
for
fighting
it
and
winning
out
Heads
that
had
drooped
in
discouragement
were
raised
The
cattle
keep
increased
and
with
it
came
the
farmer's
wealth
Marl
changes
the
character
of
the
heath
soil
with
manure
to
fertilize
it
there
was
no
reason
why
it
should
not
grow
crops--none
except
the
withering
blast
of
the
west
wind
The
time
for
Dalgas
to
preach
tree
planting
had
come
While
the
canal
digger
and
marl
seeker
were
at
work
there
had
been
neighborhood
meetings
and
talks
at
which
Captain
Dalgas
did
the
talking
When
he
spoke
the
heath
boer
listened
for
he
had
learned
to
look
upon
him
as
one
of
them
He
wore
no
gold
lace
A
plain
man
in
every-day
gray
tweeds
with
his
trousers
tucked
into
his
boots
he
spoke
to
plain
people
of
things
that
concerned
them
vitally
and
in
a
way
they
could
understand
So
when
he
told
them
that
the
heath
had
once
been
forest-clad
at
least
a
large
part
of
it
and
pointed
them
to
the
proofs
and
that
the
woods
could
be
made
to
grow
again
to
give
them
timber
and
shelter
and
crops
they
gave
heed
It
was
worth
trying
at
any
rate
The
shelter
was
the
immediate
thing
They
began
planting
hedges
about
their
homesteads
not
always
wisely
for
it
is
not
every
tree
that
will
grow
in
the
heath
The
wind
whipped
and
wore
them
the
ahl
cramped
their
roots
and
they
died
The
ahl
is
the
rusty-red
crust
that
forms
under
the
heather
in
the
course
of
the
ages
where
the
desert
rules
Sometimes
it
is
a
loose
sandstone
formation
sometimes
it
carries
as
much
as
twenty
per
cent
of
iron
that
is
absorbed
from
the
upper
layers
of
the
sand
In
any
case
it
must
be
broken
through
no
tree
root
can
do
it
The
ahl
the
poverty
of
the
sand
and
the
wind
together
make
the
"evil
genius
of
the
heath
that
had
won
until
then
in
the
century-old
fight
with
man
But
this
time
he
had
backing
and
was
not
minded
to
give
up
The
Heath
Society
was
there
to
counsel
to
aid
And
soon
the
hedges
took
hold
and
gardens
grew
in
their
shelter
There
is
hardly
a
farm
in
all
west
Jutland
to-day
that
has
not
one
even
if
the
moor
waits
just
beyond
the
gate
Out
in
the
desert
the
Society
had
made
a
beginning
with
plantations
of
Norway
spruce
They
took
root
but
the
heather
soon
overwhelmed
the
young
plants
Not
without
a
fight
would
this
enemy
let
go
its
grip
upon
the
land
It
had
smothered
the
hardy
Scotch
pine
in
days
past
and
now
the
spruce
was
in
peril
Searching
high
and
low
for
something
that
would
grow
fast
and
grow
green
Dalgas
and
his
associates
planted
dwarf
pine
with
the
spruce
Strangely
it
not
only
grew
itself
but
proved
to
be
a
real
nurse
for
the
other
The
spruce
took
a
fresh
start
and
they
grew
vigorously
together--for
a
while
Then
the
pine
outstripped
its
nursling
and
threatened
to
smother
it
The
spruce
was
the
more
valuable
the
other
was
at
best
little
more
than
a
shrub
The
croaker
raised
his
voice
the
black
heath
had
turned
green
but
it
was
still
heath
of
no
value
to
any
one
then
or
ever
He
had
not
reckoned
with
Dalgas
The
captain
of
engineers
could
use
the
axe
as
well
as
the
spade
He
cut
the
dwarf
pine
out
wherever
the
spruce
had
got
its
grip
and
gave
it
light
and
air
And
it
grew
big
and
beautiful
The
Heath
Society
has
now
over
nineteen
hundred
plantations
that
cover
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
acres
and
the
State
and
private
individuals
inspired
by
the
example
it
set
have
planted
almost
as
large
an
area
The
ghost
of
the
heath
has
been
laid
for
all
time
Go
now
across
the
heath
and
see
the
change
forty
years
have
wrought
You
shall
seek
in
vain
the
lonely
shepherd
with
his
stocking
The
stocking
has
grown
into
an
organized
industry
In
grandfather's
day
the
farmer
and
his
household
"knitted
for
the
taxes"
if
all
hands
made
enough
in
the
twelvemonth
to
pay
the
tax-gatherer
they
had
done
well
Last
year
the
single
county
of
Hammerum
of
which
more
below
sold
machine-made
underwear
to
the
value
of
over
a
million
and
a
half
kroner
The
sheep
are
there
but
no
longer
lean
no
more
the
ling-thatched
hut
but
prosperous
farms
backed
by
thrifty
groves
with
hollyhock
and
marigold
in
the
dooryards
heaps
of
gray
marl
in
the
fields
tiny
rivulets
of
water
singing
the
doom
of
the
heath
in
the
sand
for
where
it
comes
the
heather
moves
out
A
resolute
thrifty
peasantry
looks
hopefully
forward
Not
all
of
the
heath
is
conquered
yet
Roughly
speaking
thirty-three
hundred
square
miles
of
heath
confronted
Dalgas
in
1866
Just
about
a
thousand
remain
for
those
who
come
after
to
wrestle
with
but
already
voices
are
raised
pleading
that
some
of
it
be
preserved
untouched
for
its
natural
beauty
while
yet
it
is
time
Meanwhile
the
plow
goes
over
fresh
acres
every
year--once
twice
then
a
deeper
plowing
this
time
to
break
the
stony
crust
and
the
heath
is
ready
for
its
human
mission
From
the
Society's
nurseries
that
are
scattered
through
the
country
come
thousands
of
tiny
trees
and
are
set
out
in
the
furrows
two
of
the
spruce
for
each
dwarf
pine
till
the
nurse
has
done
her
work
Then
she
is
turned
into
charcoal
into
tar
and
a
score
of
other
things
of
use
The
men
who
do
the
planting
in
summer
find
chopping
to
do
in
winter
in
the
older
plantations
at
good
wages
Money
is
flowing
into
the
moor
in
the
wake
of
the
water
and
the
marl
Roads
are
being
made
and
every
day
the
mail-carrier
comes
In
the
olden
time
a
stranger
straying
into
the
heath
often
brought
the
first
news
of
the
world
without
for
weeks
together
Game
is
coming
too,--roebuck
and
deer,--in
the
young
forests
The
climate
itself
is
changing
more
rain
falls
in
midsummer
when
it
is
needed
The
sand-blast
has
been
checked
the
power
of
the
west
wind
broken
The
shrivelled
soil
once
more
takes
up
and
holds
the
rains
and
the
streams
will
deepen
fish
leap
in
them
as
of
yore
Groves
of
beech
and
oak
are
springing
up
in
the
shelter
of
their
hardier
evergreen
kin
"Make
the
land
furry,
Dalgas
said
with
prophetic
eye
beholding
great
forests
taking
the
place
of
sand
and
heather
and
in
his
lifetime
the
change
was
wrought
that
is
transforming
the
barren
moor
into
the
home-land
of
a
prosperous
people
To
the
most
unlikely
of
places
through
the
very
prison
doors
his
gospel
of
hope
has
made
its
way
For
the
last
dozen
years
the
life
prisoners
in
the
Horsens
penitentiary
have
been
employed
in
breaking
and
reforesting
the
heath
and
their
keepers
report
that
the
effect
upon
them
of
the
hard
work
in
the
open
has
been
to
notably
cheer
and
brighten
them
The
discipline
has
been
excellent
There
have
been
few
attempts
at
escape
and
they
have
come
to
nothing
through
the
vigilance
of
the
other
prisoners
While
the
population
in
the
rest
of
Denmark
is
about
stationary
in
west
Jutland
it
grows
apace
The
case
of
Skåphus
farm
in
the
parish
of
Sunds
shows
how
this
happens
Prior
to
187
this
farm
of
three
thousand
acres
was
rated
the
"biggest
and
poorest
in
Denmark
Last
year
it
had
dwindled
to
three
hundred
and
fifty
acres
but
upon
its
old
land
thirty-three
homesteads
had
risen
that
kept
between
them
sixty-two
horses
and
two
hundred
and
fifty-two
cows
beside
the
sheep
and
the
manor
farm
was
worth
twice
as
much
as
before
The
town
of
Herning
sometimes
called
"the
Star
of
the
Heath,
is
the
seat
of
Hammerum
county
once
the
baldest
and
most
miserable
on
the
Danish
mainland
In
184
twenty-one
persons
lived
in
Herning
To-day
there
are
more
than
six
thousand
in
a
town
with
handsome
buildings
gas
electric
lighting
and
paved
streets
The
heath
is
half
a
dozen
miles
away
And
this
is
not
the
result
of
any
special
or
forced
industry
but
the
natural
healthy
growth
of
a
centre
for
an
army
of
industrious
men
and
women
winning
back
the
land
of
their
fathers
by
patient
toil
All
through
the
landscape
one
sees
from
the
train
the
black
giving
way
to
the
green
Churches
rear
their
white
gables
bells
that
have
been
silent
since
the
Black
Death
stalked
through
the
land
once
more
call
the
people
to
worship
on
the
old
sites
More
churches
were
built
in
the
reign
of
"the
good
King
Christian,
who
has
just
been
gathered
to
his
fathers
than
in
all
the
centuries
since
the
day
of
the
Valdemars
Bog
cultivation
is
the
Heath
Society's
youngest
child
The
heath
is
full
of
peat-bogs
that
only
need
the
sand
so
plentiful
on
the
uplands
to
make
their
soil
as
good
as
the
best
the
muck
of
the
bog
being
all
plant
food
and
they
have
a
surplus
of
water
to
give
in
exchange
With
hope
the
keynote
of
it
all
the
State
has
taken
up
the
herculean
task
of
keeping
down
the
moving
sands
of
the
North
Sea
coast
All
along
it
is
a
range
of
dunes
that
in
the
fierce
storms
of
that
region
may
change
shape
and
place
in
a
single
night
The
"sand
flight
at
times
reached
miles
inland
and
threatened
to
bury
the
farmer's
acres
past
recovery
Austrian
fir
and
dwarf
pine
now
grow
upon
the
white
range
helping
alike
to
keep
down
the
sand
and
to
bar
out
the
blast
With
this
exception
the
great
change
has
been
is
being
wrought
by
the
people
themselves
It
was
for
their
good
in
the
apathy
that
followed
1864
that
it
should
be
so
and
Dalgas
saw
it
The
State
aids
the
man
who
plants
ten
acres
or
more
and
assumes
the
obligation
to
preserve
the
forest
intact
the
Heath
Society
sells
him
plants
at
half-price
and
helps
him
with
its
advice
It
disposes
annually
of
over
thirteen
million
young
trees
The
people
do
the
rest
and
back
the
Society
with
their
support
The
Danish
peasant
has
learned
the
value
of
coöperation
since
he
turned
dairy
farmer
and
associations
for
irrigation
for
tree
planting
and
garden
planting
are
everywhere
They
even
reach
across
the
ocean
This
year
a
call
was
issued
to
sons
of
the
old
soil
who
have
found
a
new
home
in
America
to
join
in
planting
a
Danish-American
forest
in
the
desert
where
hill
and
heather
hide
a
silvery
lake
in
their
deep
shadows
and
returning
wanderers
may
rest
and
dream
of
the
long
ago
Soldier
though
he
was
Enrico
Dalgas's
pick
and
spade
brigade
won
greater
victories
for
Denmark
than
her
armies
in
two
wars
He
literally
"won
for
his
country
within
what
she
had
lost
without.
A
natural
organizer
a
hard
worker
who
found
his
greatest
joy
in
his
daily
tasks
a
fearless
and
lucid
writer
who
yet
knew
how
to
keep
his
cause
out
of
the
rancorous
politics
that
often
enough
seemed
to
mistake
partisanship
for
patriotism
he
was
the
most
modest
of
men
Praise
he
always
passed
up
to
others
At
the
"silver
wedding
of
the
Society
he
founded
they
toasted
him
jubilantly
but
he
sat
quiet
a
long
time
When
at
last
he
arose
it
was
to
make
this
characteristic
little
speech
"I
thank
you
very
much
His
Excellency
the
Minister
of
the
Interior
who
is
present
here
will
see
from
this
how
much
you
think
of
me
and
possibly
my
recommendation
that
the
State
make
a
larger
contribution
to
the
Heath
Society's
treasury
may
thereby
acquire
greater
weight
with
him
I
drink
to
an
increased
appropriation.
On
the
heath
Dalgas
was
prophet
prince
and
friend
of
the
people
In
the
crowds
that
flocked
about
his
bier
homespun
elbowed
gold
lace
in
the
grief
of
a
common
loss
Boughs
of
the
fragrant
spruce
decked
his
coffin
the
gift
of
the
heath
to
the
memory
of
him
who
set
it
free
To
Dalgas
apply
the
words
of
the
seer
with
which
he
himself
characterized
the
Society
that
was
the
child
of
his
heart
and
brain
"The
good
men
are
those
who
plant
and
water,
for
they
add
to
the
happiness
of
mankind

Frederiksborg
one
of
the
most
beautiful
castles
in
Europe
In
its
chapel
the
Danish
kings
were
crowned
for
two
centuries
and
here
was
born
on
April
12
1577
King
Christian
of
the
Danish
national
hymn
which
Longfellow
translated
into
our
tongue
No
Danish
ruler
since
the
days
of
the
great
Valdemars
made
such
a
mark
upon
his
time
none
lives
as
he
in
the
imagination
of
the
people
He
led
armies
to
war
and
won
and
lost
battles
indeed
he
lost
more
than
he
won
on
land
when
matched
against
the
great
generals
of
that
fighting
era
On
the
sea
he
sailed
his
own
ship
and
was
the
captain
of
his
own
fleet
and
there
he
had
no
peer
He
made
laws
in
the
days
of
peace
and
reigned
over
a
happy
prosperous
land
In
his
old
age
misfortune
in
which
he
had
no
share
overwhelmed
Denmark
but
he
was
ever
greatest
in
adversity
and
his
courage
saved
the
country
from
ruin
The
great
did
not
love
him
overmuch
but
to
the
plain
people
he
was
ever
with
all
his
failings
which
were
the
failings
of
his
day
a
great
appealing
figure
and
lives
in
their
hearts
not
merely
in
the
dry
pages
of
musty
books
He
was
eleven
years
old
when
his
father
died
and
until
he
came
of
age
the
country
was
governed
by
a
council
of
happily
most
able
men
who
with
his
mother
gave
him
such
a
schooling
as
few
kings
have
had
He
not
only
became
proficient
in
the
languages
living
and
dead
and
in
mathematics
which
he
put
to
such
practical
use
that
he
was
among
the
greatest
of
architects
and
ship-builders
he
was
the
best
all-round
athlete
among
his
fellows
as
well
and
there
was
some
sense
in
the
tradition
that
survives
to
this
day
that
whoever
was
touched
by
him
in
wrath
did
not
live
long
for
he
was
very
tall
with
a
big
strong
body
and
when
he
struck
he
struck
hard
He
was
a
dauntless
sailor
who
knew
as
much
about
sailing
a
ship
as
any
one
of
his
captains
and
much
more
about
building
it
Danger
appealed
to
him
always
When
the
spire
on
the
great
cathedral
in
Copenhagen
threatened
to
fall
he
was
the
one
who
went
up
in
it
alone
and
gave
orders
where
and
how
to
brace
it
As
he
grew
he
sat
in
the
council
of
state
learning
kingcraft
and
showed
there
the
hard-headed
sense
of
fairness
and
justice
that
went
with
him
through
life
He
was
hardly
fourteen
when
the
case
of
three
brothers
of
the
powerful
Friis
family
came
before
the
council
They
had
attacked
another
young
nobleman
in
the
street
struck
off
one
of
his
hands
and
crippled
the
other
Because
of
their
influence
the
council
was
for
being
lenient
atrocious
as
the
crime
was
A
fine
was
deemed
sufficient
The
young
prince
asked
if
there
were
not
some
law
covering
the
case
with
severer
punishment
and
was
told
that
in
the
province
of
Skaane
there
was
such
a
law
that
applied
to
serfs
But
the
assault
had
not
been
committed
in
Skaane
and
these
were
high
noblemen
"All
the
worse
for
them,
said
the
prince
"Is
then
a
serf
in
Skaane
to
have
more
rights
under
the
law
than
a
nobleman
in
the
rest
of
Denmark
Let
the
law
for
the
serf
be
theirs.
And
the
judgment
stood
He
had
barely
attained
his
majority
when
the
young
king
was
called
upon
to
judge
between
another
great
noble
and
a
widow
whom
he
sued
for
900
daler
money
he
claimed
to
have
lent
to
her
husband
In
proof
he
laid
before
the
judges
two
bonds
bearing
the
signatures
of
husband
and
wife
The
widow
denounced
them
as
forgeries
but
the
court
decided
that
she
must
pay
She
went
straight
to
the
King
with
her
story
assuring
him
that
she
had
never
heard
of
the
debt
The
King
sent
for
the
bonds
and
upon
close
scrutiny
discovered
that
one
of
them
was
on
paper
bearing
the
water-mark
of
a
mill
that
was
not
built
till
two
years
after
the
date
written
in
the
bond
The
noble
was
arrested
and
the
search
of
his
house
brought
to
light
several
similar
documents
waiting
their
turn
He
went
to
the
scaffold
His
rank
only
aggravated
his
offence
in
the
eyes
of
the
King
No
wonder
the
fame
of
this
judge
spread
quickly
through
the
land
A
dozen
contented
years
he
reigned
in
peace
doing
justice
between
man
and
man
at
home
Then
the
curse
of
his
house
gripped
him
In
two
centuries
since
the
brief
union
between
the
three
Scandinavian
kingdoms
was
broken
by
the
secession
of
Sweden
only
two
of
sixteen
kings
in
either
country
had
gone
to
their
rest
without
ripping
up
the
old
feud
It
was
now
Christian's
turn
The
pretext
was
of
little
account
there
was
always
cause
enough
Gustav
Adolf
whose
father
was
then
on
the
throne
of
Sweden
said
in
after
years
that
there
was
no
one
he
had
such
hearty
admiration
for
and
whose
friend
he
would
like
so
well
to
be
as
Christian
IV
"The
mischief
is
that
we
are
neighbors.
King
Christian
crossed
over
into
Sweden
and
laid
siege
to
the
strong
fortress
of
Kalmar
where
he
first
saw
actual
war
and
showed
himself
a
doughty
campaigner
of
intrepid
courage
It
came
near
costing
him
his
life
when
a
cannoneer
with
whom
he
had
often
talked
on
his
rounds
deserted
to
the
enemy
and
picked
the
King
out
as
his
especial
target
Twice
he
killed
an
officer
attending
upon
him
but
the
King
he
never
hit
It
is
almost
a
pleasure
to
record
that
when
he
tried
it
again
in
another
fight
Christian
caught
him
and
dealt
with
him
as
the
traitor
he
was
though
the
rough
justice
of
those
days
is
not
pleasant
to
dwell
on
The
besieged
tried
to
create
a
diversion
by
sneaking
into
camp
at
night
and
burying
wax
images
of
the
King
and
his
generals
in
the
earth
where
they
were
afterwards
found
and
spread
consternation
through
the
army
for
such
things
were
believed
to
be
wrought
by
witchcraft
and
to
bring
bad
luck
to
those
whom
they
represented
However
neither
the
real
courage
of
the
defenders
nor
their
dallying
with
the
black
art
helped
them
any
King
Christian
stormed
the
town
at
the
head
of
his
army
and
took
it
The
burgomaster
hid
in
the
church
disguised
as
a
priest
and
pretended
to
be
shriving
some
women
when
the
crash
came
but
it
did
not
save
him
When
the
Swedish
king
came
with
a
host
twice
the
size
of
his
own
there
was
a
battle
royal
but
Christian
drove
him
off
and
laid
siege
to
the
castle
where
dissension
presently
arose
between
the
garrison
and
its
commander
who
was
for
surrendering
In
the
midst
of
their
noisy
quarrel
King
Christian
was
discovered
standing
upon
the
wall
calmly
looking
on
He
had
climbed
up
alone
on
a
rope
ladder
which
the
sentinel
let
down
at
his
bidding
At
the
sight
they
gave
it
up
and
opened
the
gates
and
the
King
wrote
home
proudly
dating
his
letter
from
"our
castle
Kalmar.
Its
loss
so
angered
the
Swedish
king
who
was
old
and
sick
that
he
challenged
Christian
to
single
combat
without
armor
The
letters
that
passed
between
them
were
hardly
kingly
King
Christian
wrote
that
he
had
other
things
to
do
"Better
catch
a
doctor
old
man
and
have
your
head-piece
looked
after.
Helpless
anger
killed
Karl
and
Gustav
Adolf
of
whom
the
world
was
presently
to
hear
took
the
command
and
the
crown
After
that
Christian
had
a
harder
road
to
hoe
A
foretaste
of
it
came
to
him
when
he
tried
to
surprise
the
fortress
of
Gullberg
near
the
present
Götaborg
Its
commander
was
wounded
early
in
the
fight
but
his
wife
who
took
his
place
more
than
filled
it
She
and
her
women
poured
boiling
lye
upon
the
attacking
Danes
until
they
lay
"like
scalded
pigs
under
the
walls
Their
leader
knew
when
he
had
enough
and
made
off
in
haste
with
the
lady
commandant
calling
after
him
"You
were
a
little
unexpected
for
breakfast
but
come
back
for
dinner
and
we
will
receive
you
properly.
She
would
not
even
let
them
take
their
dead
away
"Since
God
gave
us
luck
to
kill
them,
she
said
"we
will
manage
to
bury
them
too.
They
were
very
pious
days
after
their
own
fashion
and
God
was
much
on
the
lips
of
his
servants
Troubles
rarely
come
singly
Soon
after
King
Christian
met
the
enemy
unexpectedly
and
was
so
badly
beaten
that
for
the
second
time
he
had
to
run
for
it
though
he
held
out
till
nearly
all
his
men
had
fallen
His
horse
got
mired
in
a
swamp
with
the
pursuers
close
behind
The
gay
and
wealthy
Sir
Christen
Barnekow
who
had
been
last
on
the
field
passed
him
there
and
at
once
got
down
and
gave
him
his
horse
It
meant
giving
up
his
life
and
when
Sir
Christen
could
no
longer
follow
the
fleeing
King
he
sat
down
on
a
rock
with
the
words
"I
give
the
King
my
horse
the
enemy
my
life
and
God
my
soul.
The
rock
is
there
yet
and
the
country
folk
believe
that
the
red
spots
in
the
granite
are
Christen
Barnekow's
blood
which
all
the
years
have
not
availed
to
wash
out
They
tired
of
fighting
at
last
and
made
it
up
Sweden
paid
Denmark
a
million
daler
for
the
rest
things
stayed
as
they
had
been
before
King
Christian
had
shown
himself
no
mean
fighter
but
the
senseless
sacking
and
burning
of
town
and
country
that
was
an
ugly
part
of
those
days
warfare
went
against
his
grain
and
he
tried
to
persuade
the
Swedes
to
agree
to
leave
that
out
in
future
Gustav
Adolf
had
not
yet
grown
into
the
man
he
afterward
became
"As
to
the
burning,
was
his
reply
"seeing
that
it
is
the
usage
of
war
and
we
enemies
why
we
will
each
have
to
do
the
best
we
can,
which
meant
the
worst
Had
the
two
kings
who
had
much
in
common
got
together
in
the
years
of
peace
that
followed
much
misery
might
have
been
saved
Denmark
and
a
black
page
of
history
might
read
very
differently
For
those
were
the
days
of
the
Thirty
Years
War
in
which
together
they
might
have
dictated
peace
to
harassed
Europe
Now
King
Christian's
ambition
his
piety
for
he
was
a
sincerely
religious
man
as
well
as
his
jealousy
of
his
younger
rival
and
of
the
growing
power
of
Sweden--so
mixed
are
human
motives--made
him
yield
to
the
entreaties
of
the
hard-pressed
Protestant
princes
to
take
up
alone
their
cause
against
the
German
Emperor
He
had
tried
for
half
a
dozen
years
to
make
peace
between
them
At
last
he
drew
the
sword
and
went
down
to
force
it
After
a
year
of
fighting
Tilly
and
Wallenstein
the
Emperor's
great
generals
he
met
the
former
in
a
decisive
battle
at
Lutter-am-Baremberg
King
Christian's
army
was
beaten
and
put
to
rout
He
himself
fled
bareheaded
through
the
forests
of
the
Hartz
Mountains
pursued
by
the
enemy's
horsemen
It
was
hardly
necessary
for
the
Emperor
to
make
him
promise
as
the
price
of
peace
to
keep
out
of
German
affairs
thenceforth
His
allies
had
left
him
to
fight
it
out
alone
All
their
fine
speeches
went
for
nothing
when
it
came
to
the
test
and
King
Christian
rode
back
to
Denmark
a
sadder
and
wiser
man
It
was
left
to
Gustav
Adolf
after
all
to
teach
the
German
generals
the
lesson
they
needed
In
the
years
of
peace
before
that
unhappy
war
Danish
trade
and
Danish
culture
had
blossomed
exceedingly
thanks
to
the
wisdom
the
clever
management
and
untiring
industry
of
the
King
He
built
factories
cloth-mills
silk-mills
paper-mills
dammed
the
North
Sea
out
from
the
rich
marshlands
with
great
dikes
taught
the
farmers
profitable
ways
of
tilling
their
fields
for
he
was
a
wondrous
manager
for
whom
nothing
was
too
little
and
nothing
too
big
He
kept
minute
account
of
his
children's
socks
and
little
shirts
and
found
ways
of
providing
money
for
his
war-ships
and
for
countless
building
schemes
he
had
in
hand
both
in
Denmark
and
Norway
For
many
of
them
he
himself
drew
the
plans
Wherever
one
goes
to
this
day
his
monogram
which
heads
this
story
stares
at
him
from
the
splendid
buildings
he
erected
The
Bourse
in
Copenhagen
and
the
Round
Tower
the
beautiful
palace
of
Rosenborg
a
sort
of
miniature
of
his
beloved
Frederiksborg
which
also
he
rebuilt
on
a
more
magnificent
scale--these
are
among
his
works
which
every
traveller
in
the
North
knows
He
built
more
cities
and
strongholds
than
those
who
went
before
or
came
after
him
for
centuries
Christiania
and
Christiansand
in
Norway
bear
his
name
He
laid
out
a
whole
quarter
of
Copenhagen
for
his
sailors
and
the
quaint
little
houses
still
serve
that
purpose
Regentsen
a
dormitory
for
poor
students
at
the
university
was
built
by
him
He
created
seven
new
chairs
of
learning
and
saw
to
it
that
all
the
professors
got
better
pay
He
ferreted
out
and
dismissed
in
disgrace
all
the
grafting
officials
in
Norway
and
administered
justice
with
an
even
hand
At
the
same
time
he
burned
witches
without
end
or
let
it
be
done
for
their
souls
sake
That
was
the
way
of
his
time
and
when
he
needed
fireworks
for
his
son's
wedding
(he
made
them
himself
too)
he
sent
around
to
all
the
old
cloisters
and
cathedral
churches
for
the
old
parchments
they
had
Heaven
only
knows
what
treasures
that
can
never
be
replaced
went
up
in
fire
and
smoke
for
that
one
night's
fun
King
Christian
founded
a
score
of
big
trading
companies
to
exploit
the
East
taking
care
that
their
ships
should
have
their
bulwarks
pierced
for
at
least
six
guns
so
that
they
might
serve
as
war-ships
in
time
of
need
He
sent
one
expedition
after
another
to
the
waters
of
Greenland
in
search
of
the
Northwest
Passage
It
was
on
the
fourth
of
these
in
1619
that
Jens
Munk
with
two
ships
and
sixty-four
sailors
was
caught
in
the
ice
of
Hudson
Bay
and
compelled
to
winter
there
One
after
another
the
crew
died
of
hunger
and
scurvy
When
Jens
Munk
himself
crept
out
from
what
he
had
thought
his
death-bed
he
found
only
two
of
them
all
alive
Together
they
burrowed
in
the
snow
digging
for
roots
until
spring
came
when
they
managed
to
make
their
way
down
to
Bergen
in
the
smallest
of
the
two
vessels
Jens
Munk
had
deserved
a
better
end
than
he
got
He
spun
his
yarns
so
persistently
at
court
that
he
got
to
be
a
tiresome
bore
and
at
last
one
day
the
King
told
him
that
he
had
no
time
to
listen
to
him
Whereat
the
veteran
took
great
umbrage
and
slapping
his
sword
let
the
King
know
that
he
had
served
him
well
and
was
entitled
to
better
treatment
Christian
snatched
the
weapon
in
anger
and
struck
him
with
the
scabbard
The
sailor
never
got
over
it
"He
withered
away
and
died,
says
the
tradition
It
was
the
old
superstition
but
whether
that
killed
him
or
not
the
King
lost
a
good
man
in
Jens
Munk
He
was
not
averse
to
hearing
the
truth
though
when
boldly
put
When
Ole
Vind
a
popular
preacher
offended
some
of
the
nobles
by
his
plain
speech
and
they
complained
to
the
King
he
bade
him
to
the
court
and
told
him
to
preach
the
same
sermon
over
Master
Vind
was
game
and
the
truths
he
told
went
straight
home
for
he
knew
well
where
the
shoe
pinched
But
King
Christian
promptly
made
him
court
preacher
"He
is
the
kind
we
need
here,
he
said
There
was
never
a
day
that
the
King
did
not
devoutly
read
his
Bible
and
he
was
determined
that
everybody
should
read
it
the
same
way
The
result
was
a
kind
of
Puritanism
that
filled
the
churches
and
compelled
the
employment
of
men
to
go
around
with
long
sticks
to
rap
the
people
on
the
head
when
they
fell
asleep
Christian
the
Fourth
was
not
the
first
ruler
who
has
tried
to
herd
men
into
heaven
by
battalions
But
his
people
would
have
gladly
gone
in
the
fire
for
him
He
was
their
friend
When
on
his
tramps
as
likely
as
not
he
would
come
home
sitting
beside
some
peasant
on
his
load
of
truck
and
would
step
off
at
the
palace
gate
with
a
"So
long
thanks
for
good
company!
He
was
everywhere
interested
in
everything
In
his
walking-stick
he
carried
a
foot-rule
a
level
and
other
tools
and
would
stop
at
the
bench
of
a
workman
in
the
navy-yard
and
test
his
work
to
see
how
well
he
was
doing
it
"I
can
lie
down
and
sleep
in
any
hut
in
the
land,
was
his
contented
boast
And
he
would
have
been
safe
anywhere
Gustav
Adolf
was
a
wise
and
generous
foe
While
he
lived
he
refused
to
listen
to
proposals
for
the
partition
of
Denmark
after
King
Christian's
defeat
in
Germany
He
knew
well
that
she
was
a
barrier
against
the
ambition
of
the
German
princes
and
that
once
she
was
out
of
the
way
Sweden's
turn
would
come
next
But
when
he
had
fallen
on
the
battle-field
of
Lützen
and
his
generals
following
in
his
footsteps
had
achieved
fame
and
lands
and
the
freedom
of
worship
for
which
he
gave
his
life
the
Swedish
statesmen
lost
their
heads
and
dreamed
of
the
erection
of
a
great
northern
Protestant
state
by
the
conquest
of
Denmark
and
Norway
to
balance
the
power
of
the
German
empire
Without
warning
or
declaration
of
war
a
great
army
was
thrown
into
the
Danish
peninsula
from
the
south
Another
advanced
from
Sweden
upon
the
eastern
provinces
and
a
fleet
hired
in
Holland
for
Swedish
money
came
through
the
North
Sea
to
help
them
over
to
the
Danish
islands
If
the
two
armies
met
Denmark
was
lost
In
Swedish
harbors
a
still
bigger
fleet
was
fitting
out
for
the
Baltic
King
Christian
was
well
up
in
the
sixties
worn
with
the
tireless
activities
of
a
long
reign
but
once
more
he
proved
himself
greater
than
adversity
When
the
evil
tidings
reached
him
in
the
midst
of
profound
peace
the
enemy
was
already
within
the
gates
The
country
lay
prostrate
The
name
of
Torstenson
the
Swedish
general
spread
terror
wherever
it
was
heard
In
the
German
campaigns
he
had
been
known
as
the
"Swedish
Lightning.
Beset
on
every
side
never
had
Denmark's
need
been
greater
The
one
man
who
did
not
lose
his
head
was
her
king
By
his
personal
example
he
put
heart
into
the
people
and
shamed
the
cowardly
nobles
He
borrowed
money
wherever
he
could
sent
his
own
silver
to
the
mint
crowded
the
work
in
the
navy-yard
by
night
and
by
day
gathered
an
army
and
hurried
with
it
to
the
Sounds
where
the
enemy
might
cross
When
the
first
ships
were
ready
he
sailed
around
the
Skaw
to
meet
the
Dutch
hirelings
"I
am
old
and
stiff,
he
said
"and
no
good
any
more
to
fight
on
land
But
I
can
manage
the
ships.
And
he
did
He
met
the
Dutchmen
in
the
North
Sea
in
under
the
Danish
coast
and
whipped
them
almost
single-handed
for
his
own
ship
_Trefoldigheden
was
for
a
long
while
the
only
one
that
wind
and
tide
would
let
come
up
with
them
That
done
he
left
one
of
his
captains
to
watch
lest
they
come
out
from
among
the
islands
where
their
ships
of
shallower
draught
had
sought
refuge
and
sailed
for
Copenhagen
Everything
that
could
carry
sail
was
ready
for
him
by
that
time
also
the
news
that
the
Swedish
fleet
of
forty-six
fighting
ships
under
Klas
Fleming
had
sailed
for
the
coast
of
Holstein
to
take
on
board
Torstenson's
army
King
Christian
lost
no
time
He
hoisted
his
flag
on
_Trefoldigheden
and
made
after
them
with
thirty-nine
ships
vowing
that
he
would
win
this
fight
or
die
At
Kolberger
Heide
the
water
outside
the
Fjord
of
Kiel
he
caught
up
with
them
and
attacked
at
once
The
battle
that
then
ensued
is
the
one
of
which
the
poet
sings
and
with
which
the
name
of
Christian
IV
is
forever
linked
At
the
outset
the
Danish
fleet
was
in
great
peril
The
Swedes
fought
gallantly
as
was
their
wont
and
they
were
three
or
four
against
one
for
most
of
the
King's
ships
came
up
slowly
some
of
them
purposely
so
it
seems
The
King
said
after
the
battle
of
certain
of
his
captains
"They
used
me
as
a
screen
between
them
and
the
enemy.
His
own
ship
and
that
of
his
chief
admiral's
bore
the
brunt
of
the
battle
for
a
long
time
_Trefoldigheden
fired
31
shots
during
the
engagement
and
at
one
time
had
four
hostile
ships
clustering
about
her
King
Christian
was
on
the
quarter-deck
when
a
cannon-ball
shivered
the
bulwark
and
one
of
his
guns
throwing
a
shower
of
splintered
iron
and
wood
over
him
and
those
near
him
killing
and
wounding
twelve
of
the
crew
The
King
himself
fell
stunned
and
wounded
in
twenty-three
places
His
right
eye
was
knocked
out
two
of
his
teeth
and
his
left
ear
hung
in
shreds
The
cry
was
raised
that
the
King
was
dead
and
panic
spread
on
board
The
story
has
it
that
a
sailor
was
sent
aloft
to
strike
the
flag
but
purposely
entangled
it
in
the
rigging
so
that
it
could
not
fall
he
could
not
bear
to
see
the
King's
ship
strike
its
colors
In
the
midst
of
the
tumult
the
aged
monarch
rose
to
his
feet
torn
and
covered
with
blood
"I
live
yet,
he
cried
"and
God
has
left
me
strength
to
fight
on
for
my
country
Let
every
man
do
his
duty.
Leaning
on
his
sword
he
led
the
fight
until
darkness
fell
and
the
battle
was
won
Denmark
was
saved
The
danger
of
an
invasion
was
averted
In
the
palace
of
Rosenborg
the
priceless
treasure
they
show
to
visitors
is
the
linen
cloth
all
blood-stained
that
bound
the
King's
face
as
he
fought
and
won
his
last
and
biggest
fight
that
day
Half
blind
his
body
black
and
blue
and
sore
from
many
bruises
King
Christian
yet
refused
to
sail
for
Copenhagen
to
have
his
wounds
attended
Three
weeks
he
lay
watching
the
narrow
inlet
behind
which
the
beaten
enemy
was
hiding
to
destroy
his
ships
when
he
came
out
Then
he
gave
over
the
command
to
another
and
hastened
to
the
province
of
Skaane
on
the
Swedish
mainland
from
which
he
expelled
a
hostile
army
But
when
his
back
was
turned
the
men
he
had
set
to
watch
fell
asleep
and
let
the
Swedish
admiral
steal
out
into
the
open
There
he
found
and
joined
the
Dutch
ships
that
had
slipped
around
the
Skaw
during
the
rumpus
Together
they
overwhelmed
the
Danish
fleet
being
now
three
to
one
and
crushed
it
The
slothful
admiral
paid
for
it
with
his
life
but
the
harm
was
done
It
was
the
last
and
heaviest
blow
The
old
King
sheathed
his
sword
and
set
his
name
to
a
peace
that
took
from
Denmark
some
of
her
ancient
provinces
with
the
bitter
sigh
"God
knows
I
had
no
share
in
this,
and
he
had
not
Even
at
the
last
he
appealed
to
the
country
to
try
the
fortunes
of
war
with
him
once
more
The
people
were
willing
but
the
nobles
wanted
peace
"however
God
send
it,
and
he
had
to
yield
The
treaty
was
made
at
Brömsebro
where
a
bridge
crossed
the
river
dividing
the
two
kingdoms
In
the
middle
of
the
river
was
an
island
and
the
negotiations
were
carried
on
in
a
tent
erected
there
the
French
and
the
Dutch
being
the
arbitrators
The
envoys
of
Sweden
and
Denmark
sat
on
opposite
sides
of
the
boundary
post
where
the
line
cut
through
each
on
the
soil
of
his
own
country
So
bitterly
did
they
hate
one
another
that
they
did
not
speak
but
wrote
their
messages
though
they
could
have
shaken
hands
where
they
sat
Even
that
was
too
close
quarters
and
they
ended
up
by
negotiating
at
second
hand
through
the
foreign
ambassadors
all
at
the
same
table
but
each
looking
straight
past
the
other
as
if
he
were
not
there
Another
touch
of
comedy
relieves
the
gloom
of
that
heavy
day
It
was
the
conquest
of
the
Särnadal
a
mountain
valley
in
Norway
just
over
the
Swedish
frontier
by
Pastor
Buschovius
who
Bible
in
hand
at
the
head
of
two
hundred
ski-men
invaded
and
captured
it
one
winter's
day
without
a
blow
He
came
over
the
snow-fields
into
the
valley
that
had
not
seen
a
preacher
in
many
a
long
day
had
the
church
bells
rung
to
summon
the
people
preached
to
them
married
and
christened
them
and
gave
them
communion
The
simple
mountaineers
had
hardly
heard
of
the
war
and
had
nothing
against
their
neighbors
over
the
mountain
They
joined
Sweden
then
and
there
at
the
request
of
the
preacher
and
they
stayed
Swedes
too
for
in
the
final
muster
they
were
forgotten
with
their
valley
Very
likely
the
treaty-makers
did
not
know
that
it
existed
King
Christian
died
four
years
later
in
1648
past
the
three
score
and
ten
allotted
to
man
He
was
not
a
great
leader
like
Gustav
Adolf
and
he
was
very
human
in
some
of
his
failings
But
he
was
a
strong
man
a
just
king
and
a
father
of
his
people
who
still
cling
to
his
memory
with
more
than
filial
affection
GUSTAV
ADOLF
THE
SNOW-KING
The
city
of
Prague
the
capital
of
Bohemia
went
wild
with
excitement
one
spring
morning
in
the
year
1618
The
Protestant
Estates
of
Germany
had
met
there
to
protest
against
the
aggressions
of
the
Catholic
League
and
the
bad
faith
of
the
Emperor
who
had
guaranteed
freedom
of
worship
in
the
land
and
had
now
sent
two
envoys
to
defy
the
meeting
and
declare
it
illegal
In
the
old
castle
they
delivered
their
message
and
bade
the
convention
disperse
and
the
delegates
when
they
had
heard
seized
them
and
their
clerk
and
threw
them
out
of
the
window
"in
good
old
Bohemian
fashion.
They
fell
seventy
feet
and
escaped
almost
without
a
scratch
which
fact
was
accepted
by
the
Catholics
of
that
strenuous
day
as
proof
of
their
miraculous
preservation
by
the
Protestants
as
evidence
that
the
devil
ever
takes
care
of
his
own
It
was
the
tiny
spark
that
set
Europe
on
fire
Out
of
it
grew
the
Thirty
Years
War
the
most
terrible
that
ever
scourged
the
civilized
world
When
Catholic
League
and
Evangelical
Union
first
mustered
their
armies
Bohemia
had
a
prosperous
population
of
four
million
souls
when
the
war
was
over
there
were
less
than
eight
hundred
thousand
alive
in
that
unhappy
land
and
the
wolves
that
roamed
its
forests
were
scarcely
more
ferocious
than
the
human
starvelings
who
skulked
among
the
smoking
ruins
of
burned
towns
and
hamlets
Other
states
fared
little
better
Two
centuries
did
not
wipe
out
the
blight
of
those
awful
years
when
rapine
and
murder
inspired
by
bigotry
and
hate
ran
riot
in
the
name
of
religion
In
the
gloom
and
horror
of
it
all
a
noble
figure
stands
forth
alone
It
were
almost
worth
the
sufferings
of
a
Thirty
Years
War
for
the
world
to
have
gained
a
Gustav
Adolf
The
"snow-king
the
Emperor's
generals
named
him
when
he
first
appeared
on
German
soil
at
the
head
of
his
army
of
Northmen
and
they
prophesied
that
he
would
speedily
melt
once
the
southern
sun
shone
upon
his
host
They
little
knew
the
man
He
went
from
victory
to
victory
less
because
he
was
the
greatest
general
of
his
day
than
because
he
and
all
his
army
with
him
believed
himself
charged
by
the
Almighty
with
the
defence
of
his
country
and
of
his
faith
The
Emperor
had
attacked
both
the
first
by
attempting
to
extend
his
dominion
to
the
Baltic
but
Pommerania
and
the
Baltic
provinces
were
regarded
by
the
Swedish
ruler
as
the
outworks
of
his
kingdom
and
Sweden
was
Protestant
Hence
he
drew
the
sword
"Our
brethren
in
the
faith
are
sighing
for
deliverance
from
spiritual
and
bodily
thraldom,
he
said
to
his
people
"Please
God
they
shall
not
sigh
long.
That
was
his
warrant
Axel
Oxenstjerna
his
friend
and
right
hand
who
lived
to
finish
his
work
said
of
him
"He
felt
himself
impelled
by
a
mighty
spirit
which
he
was
unable
to
resist.
As
warrior
king
and
man
he
was
head
and
shoulders
above
his
time
Gustav
Adolf
saved
religious
liberty
to
the
world
He
paid
the
price
with
his
life
but
he
would
have
asked
no
better
fate
A
soldier
of
God
he
met
a
soldier's
death
on
the
field
of
battle
in
the
hour
of
victory
A
man
of
destiny
he
was
to
his
people
as
to
himself
Long
years
before
his
birth
upon
the
appearance
of
the
comet
of
1577
Tycho
Brahe
the
astronomer
who
was
deep
in
the
occultism
of
his
day
had
predicted
that
a
prince
would
appear
in
Finland
who
would
do
great
things
in
Germany
and
deliver
the
Protestant
peoples
from
the
oppression
of
the
popes
and
the
prophecy
was
applied
to
Gustav
Adolf
by
his
subjects
all
through
his
life
He
was
born
on
December
9
1594
old
style
as
they
still
reckon
time
in
Russia
Very
early
he
showed
the
kind
of
stuff
he
was
made
of
When
he
was
yet
almost
a
baby
he
was
told
that
there
were
snakes
in
the
park
and
showed
fight
at
once
"Give
me
a
stick
and
I
will
kill
them.
With
the
years
he
grew
into
a
handsome
youth
who
read
his
books
knew
his
Seneca
by
heart
was
fond
of
the
poets
and
the
great
orators
and
mastered
eight
languages
living
and
dead
At
seventeen
he
buckled
on
the
sword
and
put
the
books
away
but
kept
Xenophon
as
his
friend
for
he
was
a
military
historian
after
his
own
heart
He
was
then
Duke
of
Finland
The
King
his
father
was
a
stern
but
observant
man
who
seeing
his
bent
threw
him
with
soldiers
to
his
heart's
content
glad
to
have
it
so
for
it
was
a
warlike
age
From
his
tenth
year
he
let
him
sit
in
council
with
him
and
early
delegated
to
him
the
duty
of
answering
ambassadors
from
foreign
countries
The
lad
was
the
only
one
who
dared
oppose
the
king
when
he
was
in
a
temper
and
often
he
made
peace
and
healed
wounds
struck
in
anger
The
people
worshipped
the
fair
young
prince
and
his
father
when
he
felt
the
palsy
of
old
age
and
bodily
infirmities
creeping
upon
him
and
thought
of
his
unfinished
tasks
would
murmur
as
his
eyes
rested
upon
the
bonny
youth
"_Ille
faciet_--He
will
do
it.
There
is
still
in
existence
a
document
in
which
he
laid
down
to
him
his
course
as
a
sovereign
"First
of
all,
he
writes
"you
shall
fear
God
and
honor
your
father
and
mother
Give
your
brothers
and
sisters
brotherly
affection
love
your
father's
faithful
servants
and
requite
them
after
their
due
Be
gracious
to
your
subjects
punish
evil
and
love
the
good
Believe
in
men
but
find
out
first
what
is
in
them
Hold
by
the
law
without
respect
of
person.
It
was
good
advice
to
a
prince
and
the
king
took
it
to
heart
On
the
docket
of
the
Supreme
Court
at
Stockholm
is
a
letter
written
by
Gustav
Adolf
to
the
judges
and
ordered
by
him
to
be
entered
there
which
tells
them
plainly
that
if
any
of
them
is
found
perverting
justice
to
suit
him
the
King
or
any
one
else
he
will
have
him
flayed
alive
and
his
hide
nailed
to
the
judgment-seat
his
ears
to
the
pillory
Not
a
nice
way
of
talking
to
dignified
judges
perhaps
but
then
the
prescription
was
intended
to
suit
the
practice
if
there
was
need
The
young
king
earned
his
spurs
in
a
war
with
Denmark
that
came
near
being
his
last
as
it
was
his
first
campaign
He
and
his
horsemen
were
surprised
by
the
Danes
on
a
winter's
night
as
they
were
warming
themselves
by
a
fire
built
of
the
pews
in
the
Wittsj
church
and
they
cut
their
way
through
only
after
a
desperate
fight
on
the
frozen
lake
The
ice
broke
under
the
king's
horse
and
he
was
going
down
when
two
of
his
men
caught
him
in
the
nick
of
time
He
got
away
with
the
loss
of
his
sword
his
pistols
and
his
gloves
"I
will
remember
you
with
a
crust
that
shall
do
for
your
bairns
too,
he
promised
one
of
his
rescuers
a
stout
peasant
lad
and
he
kept
his
word
Thomas
Larsson's
descendants
a
generation
ago
still
tilled
the
farm
the
King
gave
him
When
the
trouble
with
Denmark
was
over
for
the
time
being
he
settled
old
scores
with
Russia
and
Poland
in
a
way
that
left
Sweden
mistress
of
the
Baltic
In
the
Polish
war
he
was
wounded
twice
and
was
repeatedly
in
peril
of
his
life
Once
he
was
shot
in
the
neck
and
as
the
bullet
could
not
be
removed
it
ever
after
troubled
him
to
wear
armor
His
officers
pleaded
with
him
to
spare
himself
but
his
reply
was
that
Cæsar
and
Alexander
did
not
skulk
behind
the
lines
a
general
must
lead
if
he
expected
his
men
to
follow
In
this
campaign
he
met
the
League's
troops
sent
to
chase
him
back
to
his
own
so
that
Wallenstein
the
leader
of
the
imperial
armies
might
be
"General
of
the
Baltic
Sea,
unmolested
"Go
to
Poland,
he
commanded
one
of
his
lieutenants
"and
drive
the
snow-king
out
or
else
tell
him
that
I
shall
come
and
do
it
myself.
The
proud
soldier
never
knew
how
near
he
came
to
entertaining
the
snow-king
as
his
unwilling
guest
then
In
a
fight
between
his
rear-guard
and
the
imperial
army
Gustav
Adolf
was
disarmed
and
taken
prisoner
by
two
troopers
There
was
another
prisoner
who
had
kept
his
pistol
He
handed
it
to
the
King
behind
his
back
and
with
it
he
shot
one
of
his
captors
and
brained
the
other
For
all
that
they
nearly
got
him
He
saved
himself
only
by
wriggling
out
of
his
belt
and
leaving
it
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
Eight
years
he
campaigned
in
Poland
and
Prussia
learning
the
arts
of
war
Then
he
was
ready
for
his
life-work
He
made
a
truce
with
Poland
that
freed
his
hands
for
a
season
and
went
home
to
Sweden
That
spring
(1629
he
laid
before
the
Swedish
Estates
his
plan
of
freeing
the
Protestants
To
defend
Sweden
he
declared
was
to
defend
her
faith
and
the
Estates
voted
supplies
for
the
war
To
gauge
fully
the
splendid
courage
of
the
nation
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
whole
kingdom
including
Finland
had
a
population
of
only
a
million
and
a
half
at
the
time
and
was
preparing
to
attack
the
mighty
Roman
empire
In
the
first
year
of
the
war
the
Swedish
budget
was
thirteen
millions
of
dollars
of
which
nine
and
a
half
went
for
armaments
The
whole
army
which
Gustav
Adolf
led
into
Germany
numbered
only
14,00
soldiers
but
it
was
made
up
of
Swedish
veterans
led
by
men
whose
names
were
to
become
famous
for
all
time
and
welded
together
by
an
unshakable
belief
in
their
commander
a
rigid
discipline
and
a
religious
enthusiasm
that
swayed
master
and
men
with
a
common
impulse
Such
a
combination
has
in
all
days
proven
irresistible
The
King's
farewell
to
his
people--he
was
never
to
see
Sweden
again--moved
a
nation
to
tears
He
spoke
to
the
nobles
the
clergy
and
to
the
people
admonishing
them
to
stand
together
in
the
hard
years
that
were
coming
and
gave
them
all
into
the
keeping
of
God
They
stood
on
the
beach
and
watched
his
ships
sail
into
the
sunset
until
they
were
swallowed
up
in
glory
Then
they
went
back
home
to
take
up
the
burden
that
was
their
share
On
the
Rügen
shore
the
King
knelt
with
his
men
and
thanked
God
for
having
brought
them
safe
across
the
sea
then
seized
a
spade
and
himself
turned
the
first
sod
in
the
making
of
a
camp
"Who
prays
well
fights
well,
he
said
He
was
not
exactly
hospitably
received
The
old
Duke
of
Pommerania
would
have
none
of
him
begged
him
to
go
away
and
only
when
the
King
pointed
to
his
guns
and
hinted
that
he
had
keys
well
able
to
open
the
gates
of
Stettin
his
capital
did
he
give
in
and
promise
help
The
other
German
princes
with
one
or
two
exceptions
were
as
cravenly
short-sighted
They
held
meetings
and
denounced
the
Emperor
and
his
lawless
doings
but
Gustav
they
would
not
help
The
princes
of
Brandenburg
and
of
Saxony
the
two
Protestant
Electors
of
the
empire
were
rather
disposed
to
hinder
him
if
they
might
though
Brandenburg
was
his
brother-in-law
Only
when
the
King
threatened
to
burn
the
city
of
Berlin
over
his
head
did
he
listen
While
he
was
yet
laboring
with
them
recruiting
his
army
and
keeping
it
in
practice
by
driving
the
enemy
out
of
Pommerania
news
reached
him
of
the
fall
of
Magdeburg
the
strongest
city
in
northern
Germany
that
had
of
its
own
free
will
joined
his
cause
The
sacking
of
Magdeburg
is
one
of
the
black
deeds
of
history
In
a
night
the
populous
city
was
reduced
to
a
heap
of
smoking
ruins
under
which
twenty
thousand
men
women
and
children
lay
buried
Not
since
the
fall
of
Jerusalem

Pappenheim
Tilly's
famous
cavalry
leader
to
whom
looting
and
burning
were
things
of
every
day
had
so
awful
a
visitation
befallen
a
town
Only
the
great
cathedral
and
a
few
houses
near
it
were
left
standing
The
history
of
warfare
of
the
Christian
peoples
of
that
day
reads
like
a
horrid
nightmare
The
fighting
armies
left
a
trail
of
black
desolation
where
they
passed
"They
are
not
made
up
of
birds
that
feed
on
air,
sneered
Tilly
Peaceful
husbandmen
were
murdered
the
young
women
dragged
away
to
worse
than
slavery
and
helpless
children
spitted
upon
the
lances
of
the
wild
landsknechts
and
tossed
with
a
laugh
into
the
blazing
ruins
of
their
homes
But
no
such
